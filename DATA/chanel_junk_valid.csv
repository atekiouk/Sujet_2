I haven’t had seabream since the last time we went to the elaphiti_islands off the coast of experiencedubrovnik. Gelato was so cute as it was made in the shape of a rose.

37,"There’s a real beauty in balance. 

Growing up I had a few bottles of fragrance that I had gotten for Christmas and Birthdays and such, but a majority of the time I relied on my dad’s collection and sprayed from it regularly. Fast forward to when I was just getting ready to move out of state and away from home following Community College, one day I was window shopping and came across this then, fairly new release called Allure Homme by Chanel. I fell in love with that fragrance. That day I ended up buying it, my first bottle of perfume ever. I love it so much. I lost track of how bottles I’ve gone through. 

I had never smelled anything like it and haven’t since. In my opinion it’s perfect. At least it’s perfect for me. It’s perfect in Spring, it’s perfect in Summer, it’s perfect in Fall and Winter. It works brilliantly during the day, is ideal for the office, shines at night and like the title states it’s alluring in those date night situations. 

This isn’t overly bright, but has a Rich Juiciness that gets topped with a gorgeous Aldehydic Sparkle. It has a Soft, Smooth Creaminess that’s backed by a Light, but Solid Woodiness. There’s a fine grit Spice that’s paralleled by a velvety texture. And finally it has a beautiful Muskiness that’s in the mix. This is impeccably blended and all of these elements are active and play harmoniously with one another. It’s the best balanced fragrances that I’ve experienced. This fragrance makes me feel excited, ready for anything, yet calm and confident, where I’m able to be still and drink in the moment. 

I know that this is less of a review and more me just raving about something I love, but this is hands down my all-time favorite fragrance. I know that much of that for me is probably associated with memories. As you could probably tell this was more or less a signature scent for me during the part of my life when anything was possible. But, I do think that I’d be able to smell this today and still be as big of a fan of it. I don’t think I’ve ever used the word Masterpiece, but for me to date this would be the one and only Masterpiece.

If you could only label one fragrance as a masterpiece which one would it be?"

dotwillow , the Nomad Model.

Beatiful Daria... altough models are travelling all the time, Daria really is the nomad model, born in Ukraine, raised in Canada, once trabeled to Peru to lived for months with an indegenous family and ended up living with her boyfirend in Ireland.Probably one of the most carismatic, enigmatic, lovable and misterious models ever. From her statuesque body, her bright almost purple eyes, her kind smile, her face, I could never forget that beatiful face, and her magnetic! yet peaceful and high vibrating aura, there is nothing not to love about Daria. She became one of the biggest models in the industry, not just of her era, of all of time, and during the prime of her modelling career, Karl was right next to her. Daria scored 3 Chanel campaigns, SS 2005, FW 2005 and SS 2006. She also opened 2 shows for Karl, Fendi FW 2006 and Chanel SS 2007. Cheers Daria.

94,"Aura Flora by Sally-Ann Provan Millinery ✨

Twenty-two milliners from the britishhatguild have collaborated with thejockeyclub and braintumoursch, creating headpieces in the colours of King Charles' racing silks. These pieces are being auctioned online to raise funds for Brain Tumour Research.

Aura Flora takes its name and inspiration from a loose Latin translation of “golden flowers”. The piece was moulded or ‘blocked’ by hand, using steam over a wooden block made by one of the last hat-block makers working in the UK. It is made from sinamay which is a straw material made from abaca, a member of the banana plant family growing in the Philippines and the gold sheen on the handmade silk and leather flowers is 23.5ct gold leaf, applied by hand.
 
Made with a sinamay base and decorated with gold silk and leather handmade origami flowers, with gold leaf applied and finished with black open work wire leaves, adorned with gold Swarovski crystal pearls, the piece is designed to be worn on the right.

Worn here with the 1950s raw silk ivory dress with statement bow to front by Stephanie Jane (Made in England) Available to shop now via the website ✨

⁣
As I’ve stated before, the OG 2010’s YouTube beauty gurus “raised me” in terms of my knowledge and genuine love for makeup. I could sit and watch their hauls and tutorials for hours on end, so even if it was a product that was out of reach for me to actually try, you can bet I’d at least heard of it! ⁣
⁣
Enter the granddaddy of all cream bronzers….Soleil Tan de Chanel! All the It Girls of the internet used and LOVED it, so naturally I wanted it! BUT…I wouldn’t have even known where to get it, much less been able to justify the cost to buy it back then. ⁣
⁣
Fast forward to now and chanel.beauty has reformulated and renamed the iconic bronzer AND it’s sold at ultabeauty! So you know what that means….time to cash in some points and being that baby home! ⁣
⁣
And that’s exactly what I did! The LES BEIGES Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream is now mine! ⁣
⁣
I’ve been hesitant to dig into that gorgeous, creamy swirl, but I think it’s time for me to finally give it a try! While I never tried the original formula, the research I’ve done shows that they added coconut oil to the new formula, so it is supposed to be smoother and more hydrating on dry skin, so that sounds more up my alley anyway. I will definitely let y’all know what I think after I’ve had the chance to use it for a while! ⁣
⁣
Have you used this iconic bronzer? Let me know if you have any tips/tricks for applying it! ⬇️"

The bride wore three stunning  custom dresses. 

“It has always been a dream of mine to have Chanel design my wedding dress,” Sofia says. “At my first fitting at the Chanel salons in Paris, I immediately envisioned the dress I wanted to get married in: a beautiful lace-embroidered halter gown with a long train. Within the dress are subtle details, including an embroidered heart to represent the love that Elliot and I share, as well as a blue embroidered S&E on the inside of the dress above my heart.” 

The groom wore a Tom Ford tuxedo for the wedding day.

What do you think of the wedding dress? Did you like the one she wore at the rehearsal dinner (2nd pic) and the one she wore at the afterparty? 

Tbh there's little to say: imo she looked absolutely ravishing in everything she wore."

250,"Quick Case Study: Louis Vuitton

Louis Vuitton was founded in 1854 in Paris, France, as a luggage company specializing in travel trunks.

The brand's signature monogram canvas was created in 1896 by Louis Vuitton's son, Georges. It features the LV logo and quatrefoil flower symbols and has become one of the most recognizable patterns in the fashion world.

The iconic Speedy bag was created in 1930 as a smaller version of the Keepall travel bag. It quickly became a fashion icon and has been worn by many celebrities, including Audrey Hepburn and Jessica Simpson.

Louis Vuitton is known for its collaborations with artists and designers. In 2001, the brand collaborated with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami to create the iconic Multicolore Monogram collection.

The brand's Neverfull tote bag is another iconic piece that has been popular since its introduction in 2007. Its spacious interior and stylish design have made it a favourite among fashionistas and celebrities alike.

Louis Vuitton is one of the most counterfeited luxury brands in the world. To combat this, the brand uses various anti-counterfeiting measures, such as adding holographic tags and embedding microchips in its products.

The Louis Vuitton Alma bag is another iconic piece that has been popular since its introduction in the 1930s. It was originally designed for Coco Chanel, who requested a smaller version of the brand's iconic travel trunks.

LV has a rich history of creating custom trunks for celebrities and royalty. Some of the most notable clients include Queen Elizabeth II, Muhammad Ali, and Michael Jackson.

The brand's runway shows are known for their elaborate sets and avant-garde designs. In 2012, the brand's Spring/Summer collection was shown on a giant carousel at the Louvre Museum in Paris.

Louis Vuitton has expanded beyond fashion and now offers a range of products, including jewellery, watches, and perfumes."

258,"🌷With the bittersweet conclusion of Queen Elizabeth's 70-year reign, the lessons of Elizabeth's leadership as sovereign cannot be minimalized. 

🌷Queen Elizabeth was thrust onto the throne, untethered and relatively untrained. 

🌷She inherited a multi-dimensional position as sovereign of her country and the figurehead of the Commonwealth of Nations. 

🌷For seven decades, Elizabeth forged her way through triumph, tragedy and trauma, yet experienced exponential growth and unrivaled admiration.

🌷As an entrepreneur, it is with a keen eye that we must glean through the thicket of immense experiences Elizabeth forged. 

🌷As a business owner, lessons on her leadership hold a dynamic approach to how we must conduct our business. 

🌷Queen Elizabeth understood that her platform was as a visionary. 

🌷Her platform was not focused on immediate gratification, yet it was positioned to weather volatility. 

🌷Her Majesty understood the power of playing the long game.

🗣📣👇🏻✍🏻Please, tell me 👑
The Queen is a very special and unique person?

Photographed by Karl.

“So in light of Vogue’s May cover celebrating Karl Largerfeld, and some of his beloved “Muses”, I’ve decided to celebrate the Muses that were somehow overlooked. I mean where was Claudia? Christy? Marpessa? Ines? Not even Linda or Daria?! There were certainly some interesting choices from Anna and her team, some of which I’d question as even embodying the true essence of a Muse….”

339,"On March 9, Meghan marked International Women's Day through a visit to Harvest Home, a Los Angeles charity which supports expecting mothers & their children. Along with members of the Archewell team, Meghan helped put together a baby boutique for the organization, and was seen out to lunch in LA the same day. 

For this event, the duchess chose a monochrome separates look, including a black cashmere coat by maxmara, a matching ribbed sweater possibly by the same brand, and altuzarra cropped trousers. She accessorized with her maisonvalentino sunglasses & flats, as well as a new chanelofficial statement bag which we haven't seen her carry before. For jewelry, she wore some large, possibly vintage enamel button earrings, a UFO gold necklace, and her usual bracelet stack including her cartier watch & bentleyskinner diamond bracelet.

I really loved this look on Meghan. For me an all-black look will always be the height of chic, although this one was obviously worn in LA it gives me New York or Paris style vibes. I think that's why I like it so much - while simple, this is a super versatile look that would work well for so many different occasions or locations. Personally I find that Meghan does these sort of ""upscale casual"" or borderline on/off-duty looks very well (I've included a few examples on the last slide here!). 

The cropped trouser/pointed flat is a vintage-esque feature that I always love, and as usual for me Meghan's accessorizing was pretty on point here - as a flats girl myself I love the shoes, and I'm pretty much always on board for a statement bag. The only part of the outfit I didn't like were the earrings. These seemed a little too large & out of place with the rest of the look for me - I think I would have opted for a small gold hoop or stud instead. But overall, it was a hit for me! What did you think? 🖤"
