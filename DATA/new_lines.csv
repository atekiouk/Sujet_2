21,"🌷With the bittersweet conclusion of Queen Elizabeth's 70-year reign, the lessons of Elizabeth's leadership as sovereign cannot be minimalized. 

🌷Queen Elizabeth was thrust onto the throne, untethered and relatively untrained. 

🌷She inherited a multi-dimensional position as sovereign of her country and the figurehead of the Commonwealth of Nations. 

🌷For seven decades, Elizabeth forged her way through triumph, tragedy and trauma, yet experienced exponential growth and unrivaled admiration.

🌷As an entrepreneur, it is with a keen eye that we must glean through the thicket of immense experiences Elizabeth forged. 

🌷As a business owner, lessons on her leadership hold a dynamic approach to how we must conduct our business. 

🌷Queen Elizabeth understood that her platform was as a visionary. 

🌷Her platform was not focused on immediate gratification, yet it was positioned to weather volatility. 

🌷Her Majesty understood the power of playing the long game.

🗣📣👇🏻✍🏻Please, tell me 👑
The Queen is a very special and unique person?

Aside from her wardrobe — which involved multiple  haute couture pieces, two Khaite moments, Australian label Posse and a Proenza Schouler dress that is already sold out everywhere — people are talking about Richie’s “rebrand”. Where she has gone from being someone who was always spoken about in association with other people (whether it was being the little sister of Nicole, best friend of Kylie Jenner or girlfriend of Scott Disick) to a chic young woman who holds her own. But what makes Richie different to any other uber beautiful young nepo baby? ⁠

52,"【 girlstyle.sg 】 Chanel Has New Heart-Shaped Purses + Mini Bag With Heart-Shaped Clasp & Luxe Quilted Texture
.
Chanel’s Spring-Summer 2023 collection has recently dropped in Singapore and among the extensive range of stylish  new handbags and shoes, what caught our eye were a couple of love-themed leather purses. Either shaped like hearts, or with little heart-shaped details, these chic accessories with a quilted texture will add a fine feminine touch to any getup.
.
Made from lambskin, this pristine white Chanel Wallet On Chain will be your best friend if you’re someone who likes heading out with just your phone, cash, and cards, but hates the lack of freedom that comes with constantly clutching your items in your hands. Essentially a mini bag, this minimalistic piece’s defining feature is an enamel heart-shaped clasp.
.
In contrast, the fabric on the interior of the purse is striking red. Aside from the main inner compartment is a zippered portion and multiple card slots.
.
Cute, yet bearing a certain timelessness, is this heart-shaped Chanel Clutch With Chain in shiny black patent leather. It comes with a smaller white ""baby"" version of itself which you can either use on its own, or have it clipped onto other bags as an oversized keychain cum easy-access purse.
.
If you don’t quite fancy the black patent clutch but find yourself eyeing the little Zippered Coin Purse that comes along with it, you can always purchase it as a standalone item.

Beatiful Daria... altough models are travelling all the time, Daria really is the nomad model, born in Ukraine, raised in Canada, once trabeled to Peru to lived for months with an indegenous family and ended up living with her boyfirend in Ireland.Probably one of the most carismatic, enigmatic, lovable and misterious models ever. From her statuesque body, her bright almost purple eyes, her kind smile, her face, I could never forget that beatiful face, and her magnetic! yet peaceful and high vibrating aura, there is nothing not to love about Daria. She became one of the biggest models in the industry, not just of her era, of all of time, and during the prime of her modelling career, Karl was right next to her. Daria scored 3 Chanel campaigns, SS 2005, FW 2005 and SS 2006. She also opened 2 shows for Karl, Fendi FW 2006 and Chanel SS 2007. Cheers Daria.

108,"This weekend model and influencer  married music producer  in an absolute dream location—the iconic Hotel du Cap-Eden Roc in France—and wore three incredible custom chanelofficial dresses which she shared an intimate pre-wedding look at with Vogue. Richie’s wedding wardrobe starred an exquisite beaded high-neck column gown for her rehearsal dinner; a sweeping crisscross neckline beaded lace gown for her ceremony complete with an ethereal cathedral length tulle veil; and a fun and flirty mini dress featuring a sweet structured silhouette and a signature  camellia affixed front and centre. She kept her beauty look classic and clean for every look with a midi bun and polished au naturel makeup. Sofia is an iconic bride for the ages.

I haven’t had seabream since the last time we went to the elaphiti_islands off the coast of experiencedubrovnik. Gelato was so cute as it was made in the shape of a rose. 
I wore a bodysuit from express, split hem pants from aritzia, shoes from goodamerican, belt from chanelofficial, bag from celine"
