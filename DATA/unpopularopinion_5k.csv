18236728972164005;"💖☀️New Book Review☀️💖

Title: Happy Place 
Author: Emily Henry 
Rating: ⭐️⭐️💫

🎧Song Pairing: A Place - Ocie Elliott (I wasn’t willing to put in much effort tbh) 

💭What I thought would happen:

Summer loving, obviously. I wanted Danny and Sandy without the dickish man behaviour and unnecessary makeover. This was not happy or even close to a jolly musical, downer AF. 

📖What actually happens: 

Hariet (maybe the book already lost me here as I don’t love that name) is heading to her happy place (words repeated too many times) her bestie’s vacation home where the 3 college best friends get together for shenanigans. 

When Harriet returns, turns out Sabrina also invited her “fiancé”, Wyn, they haven’t told their friends they are no longer together. The forced proximity is going to have then unpack their issues maybe provide a little closure. 

🗯Thoughts: 

Excuse me as I just woke up from this snoozer…uh oh am I about to be targeted for a hate crime because I don’t have a perma-EH boner. I’m always optimistic that her next book will actually be a favourite….

Happy Place offers nothing original what👏🏼so👏🏼ever👏🏼. At least her prior novels were written with clever humour and quick wit…this one was just a depression popsicle. 

2 positives, Emily Henry really can write that gut wrenching feeling of missing a love that is no more (it’s wasn’t over, it’s still not over vibe). Also, the cover is hot pink and fabulous so I OBVIOUSLY adore. See I’m not a complete hater. 

Of the 3 couples staying within the vacation home Harriet and Wyn are 10/10 the most dull pairing, no name vanilla ice cream levels of blah. 

This will be a selling point for many I am sure but it very much stuck with the same formula as Love & Other Words by Christina Lauren and I did not enjoy that one either. I knoooow bring on the hate my friends.

Hoy os traigo una #unpopularopinion
porque sé que este tónico es amado por aquí. Es el tónico de ziajaespana de la gama acai berry que a mí, no me ha gustado.

No he notado nada reseñable en mi piel, ni siquiera esa sensación de alivio al echar el tónico, y además no me ha gustado el olor. Al menos no me han salido granitos en la piel ni nada raro y el dosificador es genial, en modo spray. 

Pero aunque sea muy económico, no repetiría con él.
Por supuesto del tema de que ayuda con las primeras arrugas, pues nada de nada, la verdad 🤷🏻‍♀️

18029196019473258;"Unpopular knitting opinions - Many of us probably store one or two unpopular knitting opinions. Just thought it’s time I come out of the closet with one of mine: I think sleeve knitting is quite alright 🤓! I mainly knit sweaters, so with sleeves things go way faster than with the body. To be honest, the concept of sleeve island is actually quite foreign to me 🤷‍♀️. Happy to hear all the arguments against sleeve knitting tough 😄.

[the topic is inspired by woolmeoncefibers knitting challenge from last autumn, cardigan is an old favourite based on a Rowan pattern]

This will be very fun🫣

A bookstagram sweetheart: The Virgin Suicides. I understood the story, I know that it’s supposed to be social commentary on how women are seen by society, but I still think it’s poorly done. It tries too hard to make a certain point that it becomes shallow in its lack of depth, at least that’s how I saw it. I also sometimes think that if people have to defend a book by saying that you just didn’t understand the metaphors if you didn’t absolutely love it, the book clearly lacks some perspective. 

A classic: People will HATE me for this but it’s Frankenstein. I know, I know, I know, I should like it, but I’ve read it twice and it still bored me. Even though I love the premise and the overall meaning behind it, both Frankenstein and the creature are two of the most whiniest characters ever, and the story wasn’t particularly captivating imo. 

An author with a beloved backlist: It pains me to say because she was such a great woman, but I have to say Virginia Woolf. This might be something that changes in the future, because I will read more of her work, but the two ones I’ve read so far were not my thing. She has valid points, but from what I’ve seen it takes ages for her to get to the point, and I guess the writing doesn’t make up for it.

A fandom: It has to be Colleen Hoover considering I’ve heard people get literal death threats from her fans for writing even slightly negative reviews about her books… yeah.

17962471835373837;"📚⚠️𝕌𝕟𝕡𝕠𝕡𝕦𝕝𝕒𝕣 𝕠𝕡𝕚𝕟𝕚𝕠𝕟⚠️📚 ¿Por qué 𝓝𝓞 recomiendo esta novela? (No se me ofenda nadie, es solo 𝓜𝓘 opinión):

🙃 Me presentan a Poppy como fuerte y empoderada cuando no tiene nada que ver con eso; se pasa toda la novela a merced de los personajes masculinos. Hay cantidad de escenas en las que consiente que ellos (sobre todo Vikter o Howke) la traten como a una niña que necesita de su protección y que no puede decidir ni opinar por ella misma; me hace pensar que no es más que otra damisela en apuros (con todos mis respetos a las damiselas en apuros), pero que no me la vendan como lo que no es. Eso sí, cuidao, que lleva un abrecartas en el muslo. Además, el personaje es en sí incoherente por donde lo mires; entre otras cosas, ¿cómo una persona aislada del mundo puede matar sin remordimientos?

🙃La relación con Howke es de una sumisión pasmosa (la vida de Poppy, y la novela en general, pasa a girar literalmente alrededor de él). Obviando que Howke es el p*to amo de todo (para qué ponerle algún defecto y hacerlo creíble, sobre todo llegando al final), y las escenas “horny” que rozan la falta de consentimiento, la relación entre ellos (con un tira y afloja de patio de colegio) es más importante que la trama principal. A mí nadie me avisó de que estaba leyendo una novela romántica con un poco de relleno de fantasía; yo creía que era del revés, sinceramente.

🙃Vikter, personaje al que considero esencial (cumple una función estructural importante) es un decorado de fondo. Más plano que una tabla. Porque ya tenemos a Buenorro Howke para chupar protagonismo y no permitir que ningún otro personaje se desarrolle.

Y podría seguir, pero me quedo sin caracteres, y la reseña larga (y calentita) con todo detalle la dejé en Goodreads. Conclusión: no sé cómo es el resto de la saga, solo puedo juzgar De sangre y cenizas. Lo que sí puedo decir es que me molesta que novelas como esta se vendan como lo que no son (“best sellerazo”, alta cocina) y que contengan valores bastante cuestionables respecto al ejemplo para lxs lectorxs más jóvenes. Para mí ha sido una gran decepción: 1/5⭐️

After my Cleopatra & Frankenstein disaster the other day 😵‍💫 it got me thinking about other popular books that missed the mark for me! 

All of these books were somewhat of a disappointment to me - not all of them were bad per say - they just didn’t live up to the hype for me 👀

• Klara and the sun (3.5⭐️)
• The vanishing half (4⭐️ - I included this as I would definitely lower my rating in retrospect)
• Against the loveless world (2.5⭐️)
• Kim Jiyoung, born 1982 (2⭐️ - I want to reread this though as I think it was my mindset at the time)

17995030078675865;"(Probably) Unpopular Mini Reviews 😬

These last three reads have been two stars from me...I'm still on a mad search to find my next five-star read. (I've only had one so far this year...and we're almost into April.)

💀💀/5

Here's why I rated each of these books two stars:

WE WERE LIARS by E. Lockhart - I was bored to tears and nothing happened and it was so repetitive and… ahhh I wanted to like it because of everyone saying the twist and the ending was so awesome, but I didn’t care for it. I expected it to really blow my mind, but it didn’t at all. I actually thought maybe I missed something, so I went back and read it again. Nope. Still nothing. I MAY try the prequel, but not sure… because if it’s anything like this then I don’t want to.

DOWN THE RIVER UNTO THE SEA by Walter Mosley - I was excited about this book and I enjoyed the first couple of chapters, but then I lost interest. There were too many characters and two different stories in one that it was just too much to keep track of and I was confused throughout the entire book.

I do have book 2 in this series, so I'll give that one a chance, too, in hopes that it's not as complex to follow.

That all being said, there's no doubt Walter Mosley can't write. He's a great writer, which is a reason why I want to read the second book to see if I feel differently.

MOTHERED by Zoje Stage - Took me almost a month, but I finally finished this book. I liked it in the beginning and wanted to love it by the end, but I’m not quite sure what I read and the ending left me so unsatisfied.

The whole time I was questioning what’s real and what isn’t… I like weird, but this was too weird for me. I wanted less fluff in the middle and more to the point, too.

That being said, I do still want to read BABY TEETH by this author.

DO NOT let my thoughts deter you from reading these books. If they're on your list, give them a chance because you may love them.

What's been a disappointing, but fairly popular book you've read?

No i w końcu jest: ""Ten Drugi"" wydany u nas przez wydawnictwo_marginesy 🤩 Zabrałam tę książkę ze sobą do Londynu, nie mogło być inaczej 😁 Ja akurat jestem #teamharry i uważam, że Książę bardzo dobrze zrobił, że wypisał się z tego chorego układu. A że nie zrzekł się bycia Księciem? Też uważam, że dobrze. To mu się należy z urodzenia i fakt, że nie chce robić tego, do czego go próbuje przymusić system tego nie zmieni. Może to #unpopularopinion ale tak sądzę 😁 Książka Harry'ego otwiera oczy na to jak wygląda życie Royalsów i że nie jest wcale tak różowe, jak może się wydawać ""zwykłym"" ludziom. Czy napisał ją dla kasy i rozgłosu? Pewnie po części tak, ale kto mu zabroni? 😁 Dajcie znać po której stronie jesteście: team Harry, czy team reszta Royalsów 😁 No i czy czytaliście, albo macie w planach czytać ""Tego Drugiego"".

My reason behind this is similar to that Ghandi quote: 

If you pluck out the whole world’s eyes, everyone is blind. 👨‍🦯

I don’t know the exact words…but you got me, right? 

If you “fire” every client that doesn’t suit you, not only will you be broke, you won’t be challenged as a person. 🔥 

I’m a HUGE advocate for getting out of your comfort zone including dealing with difficult people, 

BUT I’m not saying to deal with ABUSIVE clients who ask for UNREASONABLE requests. Let’s get that clear. ✨ 

Allow yourself to work *sometimes* with not ideal client as a challenge to yourself. Sharpen your self-awareness a bit. Do a self-check. ✔️ 

MANY TIMES we’re just a AFRAID so we tell ourselves we only work with a certain kind of person. 😳 

THAT’s a COMFORT ZONE thing. 😬 

There are SO MANY stories about “bums” who are actually multi-billionaires who just want to prove a point. 💵🤑

We need to be accepting of EVERYONE & enforce our boundaries to attract our ideal people. 👬👭

THAT’s that Abundance mindset! 

If this is something you can’t wrap your head around, send me a DM 📬so we can work through this.

⁉️ Mit welchem Buch, das von den Meisten gemocht wird, konntet ihr so gar nichts anfangen?
.
.
Meine Kandidaten seht ihr in den Slides.
Shatter Me, Selection und die Lux-Reihe haben mich persönlich genervt. Sie könnten vor allem jüngeren Leserinnen gefallen oder allen, die gerne den Fokus auf der Romance haben und Dreiecksgeschichten mögen. Aber selbst dann würde ich diese Geschichten nicht empfehlen, weil es bessere gibt.
.
Von Never Too Close rate ich jedem ab, egal welchen Alters. Das Buch war einfach schlimm, vermittelt falsche Werte und die Prota ist so unsympathisch, dass ich mir gewwünscht habe, ihr Love Interest würde zu seiner Ex zurückkehren.
.
Normal People ist sehr subjektiv bewertet - ich konnte mich mit den Charakteren null identifizieren und es hat mich geradezu deprimiert. Aber es ist ein sehr ehrliches Buch, das von anderen vllt gemocht wird. Es ist keine klassisch-kitschige Romance!!

17876427128840345;"“What did the young people do? This suggested there was a plot, a story that was going to resolve itself.”

⭐️⭐️⭐️

Imagine if a teenaged Ted Bundy guest starred in an episode of Gossip Girl. Just a bunch of rich kids acting grown with lots of drugs, sex, and fancy parties with celebrity guests — and yeah, there’s a serial killer doing some stuff and things in the background.

As far as the suspense and thriller elements, this was right up my alley. It’s that feeling of being watched. It’s things being out of place. It’s phone calls where there’s only breathing on the other end, the sound of shuffling in the dark, and a tapping on the door in the middle of the night- it’s CREEPY. And I love it. The night in Palm Springs is easily my favorite scene. 

I was hoping for a bit more cunning from our antagonist, I want mind games and power plays, a real cat-and-mouse dynamic, but ultimately Bret and Robert don’t actually have all that much to do with each other. Bret seems to be a third wheel tagalong for much of his own story, which was a little disappointing. But there’s a seed planted in the final scenes to cast question over the reliability of our narrator, which makes up for it a little.

The biggest downfall of this book for me is how sexually focused it is. Sex isn’t typically a deal-breaker for me, in fact usually it’s a draw, but it’s so relentless in here that it becomes dull. Bret is the embodiment of the meme “great, now I’m scared AND horny” — except sometimes he switches it up to be depressed and horny or angry and horny; he’s just a walking erection with feelings, really. I eye-roll at every masturbatory fantasy. Every boy is described as porn star sexy and every girl is cast as either slutty or not-slutty. (Which made me ~cringe.) And I don’t vibe with Ellis’s writing style, which I found rather bland and repetitive, and that just sort of makes all the copious amounts of sex, drugs, song titles and reminders that it’s 1981 to be annoying. Ah, and the constant graphic animal death was also not my druthers.

Overall this wasn’t the worst, I might still recommend it to people hunting for queer thrillers (at least until I find more that I like better. 🤣)";2023-03-24 20:44:49+00:00;2023-03-27 14:35:56.669380+00:00;25;88;en

18352162780021315;"Heute habe ich mal ein Hörbuch für euch. Das Buch wird hochgelobt, für mich persönlich war es ein ziemlicher Flop. Von welchem Buch wart ihr zuletzt so richtig enttäuscht?

Arno Geiger beschreibt in ""Das glückliche Geheimnis"" von seinem jahrelang geführten Doppelleben, in dem er frühmorgens seine Runden drehte und literarische Werke aus den Papiertonnen anderer Leute fischte und weiterverwertete. Er berichtet aber auch von seinem Weg zum erfolgreichen Schriftsteller, von seinem Liebes- und Familienleben.

Ich habe zuvor noch nichts von Geiger gelesen und wurde nur durch den medialen Hype auf dieses Buch aufmerksam - kann ihn aber nicht nachvollziehen.
In meiner Vorstellung war es interessant zu erfahren, was der Autor wohl für Schätzchen im Müll anderer Leute finden würde, diese Passagen waren aber nur sehr kurz.

Generell wird zwar sehr ausschweifend erzählt, trotzdem nirgends richtig ins Detail gegangen. Für mich klangen die meisten Sätze aufgesetzt und gestelzt, es gab viele Pseudo-Weisheiten.
Sehr gestört haben mich auch die verallgemeinernden Beobachtungen zum Schluss à la ""früher war alles besser"": die Leute werden alle fetter, fauler, dümmer.
Davon ausgenommen ist natürlich Geiger, der sich selbst sehr selbstverherrlichend darstellt.

Ein weiterer Knackpunkt für mich ist die angebliche Brisanz, mit der dieses ""Geheimnis"" (welches schon direkt zu Beginn gelüftet wird) bzw. ""Doppelleben"" umworben wird: diese besteht einfach nicht.

Es gibt ein paar interessante Denkanstöße, für mich allerdings nicht genug, um ein ganzes Buch damit zu füllen und die nur 240 Seiten kamen mir ewig lang vor - da konnte auch die Inszenierung von Matthias Brandt nichts mehr reißen.

Vielleicht hatte ich falsche Erwartungen, vielleicht habe ich irgendwas nicht verstanden, vielleicht ist es auch nur etwas für Fans, die mehr über des Autors Leben erfahren möchten; auf jeden Fall erschließt sich mir nicht, warum das Buch so gefeiert wird. ⭐️1,5/5⭐️

17949867455533696;"The natashadenona Mini Nude is 1 of 2 ND palettes I own and is my favorite of the two. Largely for its everyday-neutral color story (making it an easy go-to for a quick look), but also because of the shade Sienna. 🥰 It's one of my favorite one-n-done shadows in my collection that, up until just recently, I couldn't dupe---making this palette extra special in my collection. (I plan on sharing the dupe in my next post!)

Sienna is a bronze with red undertones and a twinkling of gold & green shimmer. The green & gold shimmer more so reflects light and gives the lids somewhat of a glossy appearance than it does truly ""sparkle"" or color flip. Sienna is slightly more loosely pressed than the other 2 metallics so it's best applied with a finger or damp brush--but the shine and dose of dimension it gives the lids is so, SO beautiful! 

Swatches from top to bottom: 
-Bronzage: A copper metallic 
-Quoin: A muted orange matte
-Sienna: Described above 🥰
-Soil: A warm dark brown matte

**The 1st video clip shows swatches in indirect sunlight.
**The 2nd clip shows swatches in direct sunlight. (You can see the gold shimmer a bit better here, though, the shadow does't sparkle that intensely on the lids. As described above, it gives the lids a touch of dimension.) 

The overall quality of this palette is very good. The only con I would say is the color story leans quite warm which may not appeal to everyone depending on their skin tone.

Given the hype ND's palettes receive, I can relate to the feeling of FOMO and the strong pull to purchase her palettes. Because of that I want to share my personal experience with her palettes (I've had 6 in total, only 2 remain) and my thoughts on them in general. (Note: Unpopular opinion coming!).

Romantic Comedy by Curtis Sittenfeld
Contemporary Fiction
Out April 4, 2023

Thanks to Random House for the copy of this ARC.

I fell in love with this cover and the idea of a funny celebrity romance based on an SNL writer and a musician… but was left without so much romance or comedy in the book itself. 

Curtis Sittenfeld is clearly a talented writer - the formatting of this book was pretty cool, with the first chapter (half the book) being a backstory of how an SNL-type show works broken up by periods of time (i.e. Friday, 11:03 A.M.), the second chapter was a series of emails during the start of the pandemic in 2020, and the third was our more traditional in-person romance read. I also really liked the focus on the “Danny Horst Rule”, which is seemingly based off of SNL writers like Colin Jost and Pete Davidson who have married or dated way up, while “mousy-looking, average” female comedians would “never be able to do the same” with a male celebrity. 

So, while the premise and writing were great, the follow-through didn’t work well for me. I didn’t swoon or laugh at all in this book, which I really expected based on the title. This read much more like contemporary fiction instead of the romance it’s being labeled as on Goodreads, etc. Our main character, Sally, was also problematic. In a book centering on “average” women dating “unattainable” men, Sally repeats over and over SOOO many times that she’s unworthy, unattractive, and not good enough — even as she writes a sketch exposing this phenomenon and is developing a relationship with a very popular male musician. I definitely wanted to see more growth in that area for her. To me, this read a bit like a Sally Rooney book (I was thinking Normal People), and honestly she is also just not an author for me. 

So, this book may be for you if you like:
- Sally Rooney books
- lots and lots of details about behind-the-scenes SNL
- are interested in Colin Jost and Pete Davidson’s relationships
- are okay with an MC who constantly talks about how unattractive and unworthy she is
- fiction where romance is the subplot

What’s the last book that didn’t work so well for you?";2023-03-24 13:40:19+00:00;2023-03-27 14:35:56.669380+00:00;31;454;en

🌶️🌶️

Let me start by saying I LOVED the SPC series and I know I’m going to be in the minority, but this book wasn’t at all what I wanted it to be.  I just did not feel like I was reading an SPC book.  I’m not a fan of an insta-love trope and in this book that chemistry and burn that I wanted from Ronan & Daisy just wasn’t as strong as I expected.  They were also pretty tame in terms of spice compared to the rest of the couples in this series. 

That being said, I did love Ronan’s personality, there was a true venerability about him that was refreshing.  He was a cinnamon roll with a little bit of alpha at his core.  I cannot wait for Madame because  Eden was fabulous in this book and I would love if Geo got his own story!

But I say the opposite. We are using our skills, knowledge and potential in the place where it matters most, home… and for the people that we’re responsible for and have a duty towards. 

In regard to slide 8, let us remember to not forget ourselves. nimzyunmeasured reminded me of this: In the hadith with Abu Ad-Darda (ra), Salman (ra) reminded him, ""Your Lord has a right on you; and your soul has a right on you; and your family has a right on you; so you should give the rights of all those who have a right on you."" 

I’ve been writing disclaimers to be cautious of not offending anyone. But truthfully, these are my own personal opinions. My opinions aren’t for everyone. 

Here are some examples:
I say: I love apples.
Someone responds, YOU HATE ORANGES!?
—— I was just stating that I like apples, where did oranges come from?

I say: I homeschool my kids.
Someone responds, do you think you’re better than me since my kids go to school? 
—— I was just stating I homeschool, I never said I was better. You chose what was best for your kids, and I did the same. 

I say: Staying at home and serving my family is my role. 
Someone responds, Wow! You think you’re better than working moms? You’re so judgmental.
—— I literally just said I am a SAHM, I didn’t mention anything about working moms, nor do I get involved with what they do for themselves or their families.

Soms gebeurt het me wel eens dat ik helemaal op ga in de ‘DOE’ modus en vind dat ik nog harder moet werken, omdat ik bang ben dat ik anders niet genoeg doe en niet succesvol zal zijn en niet voor mezelf kan zorgen 🥴. Maar wat er dan juist gebeurt is dat ik mijn creativiteit verlies, ga forceren en het veel energie kost😮‍💨. Ik heb geleerd dat ik op zo’n momenten juist stil moet staan. Niet verder moet gaan met wat ik aan het doen was, maar een pauze moet nemen van een paar uur of zelfs soms een paar dagen✨. Even mediteren, wandelen in de natuur, of juist lekker met mijn handen bezig zijn. Want pas dan valt alles weer op z’n plek. Krijg ik inzichten en kom ik weer in die creatieve flow. Waardoor ik ineens nog veel harder vooruit kan gaan dan daarvoor🔥. Stil staan is voor mij dus uiteindelijk dubbel zo hard (vooruit) gaan. Maar het blijft moeilijk om daar soms aan toe te geven 🫣.

17950366751369436;"Unpopular opinion: having only the 5-star reviews on your site is bad for your business.

You need to let all the reviews show. It builds trust between you and your customers. And your customers can decide if something someone didn’t like is a good reason for them not to buy, or not!

For example: I always read every single review before I book an AirBnb. I pay attention to the 1-star reviews because if it’s something like: “this place was hard to get to without a car and the mattress was too soft” and I’ve got a car and like soft mattresses, that negative review isn’t negative to me and gives me some valuable information. 

If you allow the full spectrum of opinions to be shared it empowers your customers to make good decisions for themselves by giving them the whole picture. It reassures them that you’re not hiding anything and can be a huge contributor to trust-building between your customers and your business. 

Trust between you and your customers is a big factor in being able to sell online. Your customers need to feel confident before they buy. They want to know that you’re a legit store and not just a pretty front for a low-quality dropshipping business with inflated or fake reviews. 

Building trust is a huge factor in getting consistent sales online. Trust is what gives your customers the confidence to purchase from you! 

Not censoring your reviews to just the 5 stars can be an easy way you can build trust (and consistent sales) online.

Do you ever read a book and think: Did I read something different to everyone else? 🙈😅 that’s how I felt after finishing ‘Lessons in Chemistry’

All I've heard and seen are rave reviews for this book, but I honestly don't get the hype.
'A novel that sparks joy with every page'- I think not.
This book mostly just left me feeling sad. We have sexism, homophobia, suicide, death, rape and depression. Although I liked the feminism in this, I found Zott herself a difficult character to like, and it was disappointing that 96% of men in this book were horrible human beings- I would really like to think that not ALL men in the 50's and 60's were like this. I also found the book didn't flow very well, with jumping character pov's and timelines, which felt a bit messy.
3⭐️
This is the reason I avoid popular, accoladed fiction 🙈🙈

What’s the last hyped book you read that just fell a bit flat for you?

Halleluja, deze qoute STAAT OP MIJN LIJF GESCHREVEN. ✍️
Allemaal goed en wel dat kleuradvies, de beste modelletjes voor bepaalde lichaamstypes, ... maar het aller aller aller belangrijkste is toch dat je het zèlf mooi vindt en dat JIJ je er goed in voelt!?

So what dat ze gaan kijken, so what dat je beter staat met blauw dan met roze? Vind jij roze mooier? Dan draag je toch lekker roze, schat ✌
Onthoud: ""They will stare, make it worth their while"" 🤓

Eerlijk advies is het beste advies dat men kan geven. Sta je ergens ècht niet mee of flatteert het to-taal niet? Dan moet je dat ook durven inzien en kies je best een ander stuk. Maar laat je aub niet te snel uit je lood slaan. Schouders recht, kin omhoog and wear your favorites with pride 👑

Ik hoor het nog veel te veel: 'Wauw, ik vind dat zò mooi maar durf dat niet te dragen', 'Ja, bij jou vind ik dat geweldig, maar bij mij staat dat niet', 'Ik wou dat ik dat ook zou durven dragen/combineren', 'Ik voel me dan zo bekeken'.

Zò zò zò jammer! Maar wacht, ik maak er mijn missie van: binnenkort draag jij eender wat jij mooi vindt, ook al weet je dat je reactie krijgt van anderen. 🧡

With love, Claudia 😘

18041521549433222;"First off, let me define what I mean by 'real food'.

Real food is nutrient dense, minimally processed, grown in ways that support health, can heal bodies, mind and society. 😊

Lots of people compare junk food to real food as both good options and none are either good or bad. From a nutrient food quality point of view this is nonsense. These foods do not nourish in any way. Of course enjoy those foods but they are not equal to real food. 🌭

17985275746846722;"Hey Loss Mama,

This has been heavy on my heart as of late & I felt like it needed to be shared.

I just feel like there is absolutely no way I am not the only one who feels this way.

I know it is not what everyone wants to hear, & I understand that. But this journey of life after loss for me has been incredibly complex, eye-opening & has burst so many bubbles that I would now deem to be seen prior through rose-colors glasses & through a thick fog of toxic positivity.

It is not that I am trying to be negative, although I am sure that many will feel that way. That is also completely acceptable.

I don’t look at another Loss Mama or Infertility Warrior who is able to get pregnant after loss, struggle and then is able to have a living baby & think to myself

“If she can then I can.”

“Maybe I am next.”

“Well she has so much in common with me so then maybe I will be able to have a living baby too.”

“We are on the same timeline of loss & struggle so my time is right around the corner.”

I just don’t because I have learned that I can’t. It means nothing. Not one thing.

Well, all it means is that she is able, it is currently her journey & I have so much hope & love for her that her living baby will be here. She deserves that. We all deserve that.

When I was PAL with Baby Love, so were A LOT of other Loss Mamas… all of them are still PAL. I am not.

There is no direct correlation whether that be a joyous outcome or a tragic outcome.

Am I devastated for me? Absolutely.
Do I hold space for them and their joy alongside the complexity of PAL? Absolutely.

This life is hard whether it is full of triumphs or tragedies. We will all experience both. 

But part of my journey of life after loss & struggle in the ability to have a living baby is acknowledging that no one else’s ability to have a living baby has anything to do with my ability.

It isn’t easy to accept, but for me it has become a stark reality I cannot ignore.

How does this land for you Loss Mama?

Xox, Hails

17970630014186494;"⛸️Book Review⛸️
Keep reading for a hot take. This book was allll over booktok. And bookstagram. This book was just okay. Why? Wellllll at page 220, 50% in, I had just gotten to a main plot point that the entire book was supposed to revolve around. The first 20% I wasn’t hooked, but I LOVED the last 50%. I think a few things happened here. I think that this was a good first draft for the authors first book, but that first draft got published. The first half pacing was so off it was painful at times. And ultimately, the author has two different ideas so first half was one idea and second half was another idea. This book was picked up by a publisher so I hope that book 2 in this series is edited significantly more and is cut down to be one idea. If a book needs to be long, I’m here for it, but usually romances don’t need to be that long 🤷‍♀️ I think in this case, the author didn’t have enough beta readers and/or the editor maybe only looked at grammar vs book flow, length, pacing, plot. The last 50% I really really liked and the book could’ve started at 50% and still been a full book with no plot holes. I liked the authors writing though and I WILL be reading the next book in the series. I can’t wait to see how this author grows as she writes more books.

Did you read this one? How did you feel about it?

18024306118499806;"The other day, I saw a post in a Facebook group that went something along the lines of:

""My horse was bad and bucked me off. He 100% did it on purpose because he knows it's wrong! Lol haha lol""

It boils my p*ss 🤬

And it's not funny.

There were several comments of ""haha's"" and ""oh it's spring!"" ""Youngsters hey!""

There was ONE SINGLE COMMENT that brought the counter (and correct!!!) perspective of ""Horses can't be bad, they aren't programmed that way""

One single person came to the voice of the horse 

The OP did reply with the same original attitude, so I didn't bother to comment as clearly it would have been like talking to a wall 🙃 so I choose not to waste my breath 😮‍💨 but it SADDENS me what that horse will experience...

When you express an attitude such as this poster towards your horse, you do your horse AND yourself a huge disservice; you will NEVER have a harmonious partnership with this point of view 

I don't care if they're 4, 5, 10 or 20 years old

Or if they're a Welsh, thoroughbred or Shetland pony

Horses simply DO NOT have the physical part of the brain to even think that way!!! 

If you can't ride out a buck, that is NOT your horses fault. 

There. I said it.

It's up to you to know your level of competence and the limitations of your riding ability. 

NOT for your horse to suppress their natural behaviours or to regulate their anxiety/emotions

17921989049688187;"Hace unos días saqué a relucir el tema de los arquetipos de marca. La culpa es mia porque los mencionaba en un carrusel. 

Está bien, llega la hora de hablar de ellos - que no se diga que me achanto -.

Los arquetipos de marca son un concepto creado por Carl Jung y representan conjuntos de estándares que crean los rasgos de la personalidad, valores, cosmovisión y creencias de una organización.

Es decir, son una idea o concepto que contienen unas características descriptivas que estructuran la ""personalidad"" de una persona, o en este caso de una marca. 

Un ejemplo: Si nos remitimos a los arquetipos clásicos el mío, sería La Persona corriente

También puede ser conocido como ""el chico/chica común"" o ""la chica / chico de la puerta de al lado"".

La persona corriente no tiene fórmulas mágicas para el éxito ni te va hacer grandes promesas, a cambio son confiables, realistas y honestos. Sabe que la eficiencia se logra de manera práctica, trabajando y prefiere democratizar lo que sabe y hacerlo accesible a todos.

Ahora bien, SPOILER: ¿Soy la única que cree que reducir una persona o una marca a un arquetipo, es simplista?

Es como el eneagrama, y otras tantas herramientas similares. 

Nadie es una única cosa y tu marca tampoco.

Pero esto lo dejamos para el próximo #unpopularopinion. De momento vamos a repasar las bases de eso de los arquetipos de marca, para tenerlo claro. Porque como forma de orientar (¡ojo! a brocha gorda) la comunicación de nuestra marca no están mal. 

¿Los conocías? ¿Qué arquetipo se te ajusta más?

📚AOTD: This here was it for me.

🏑Icebreaker (Maple Hills 1) by Hannah Grace

This was the read which won the most votes in my last 'Pick my next read based on 1 star reviews' post.

🏑The winning review was this:

'To everyone who recommended this book: i am under your bed. watch out. i’m coming.'

🏑This book has almost 160.000 ratings and an average rating of 4.11 on Goodreads. Which means there are a hell lot of people out there who love it.

Unfortunately however, I am not one of them.🤷‍♀️
I ended up DNF-ing it and giving it a short and to the point 1 star review.
Which may probably make the list of another Book blogger here looking for these.😅

And it goes like this. 📚My review that is:

1 ⭐

At 30% in, I decided to throw in the towel and call it quits.

I'm just too old for this shit.

I moved on to the second book from the pick my read post. Which won second place with this review:

Mit welcher gehypten Reihe (oder welchem gehypten Einzelband) werdet ihr einfach nicht so richtig warm?

Bei mir ist das - und es schockt mich das zu sagen weil ich wirklich dachte, diese Reihe ist perfekt für mich - das Reich der sieben Höfe. 
Ich finde die Bücher gut, unterhaltsam, auch ganz spannend. Aber mehr halt auch nicht. Ich hab schon Bücher gelesen, deren Charaktere mich wesentlich mehr mitfiebern haben lassen, weinen und fluchen lassen, aber bei der Reihe bin ich auch noch drei Büchern immer noch völlig kalt. Um es ganz drastisch zu formulieren, ich glaube jeder Charakter in diesem Buch könnte sterben und mir wäre es egal. 
Ähnlich geht es mir übrigens bei Blood & Ash, das erste Buch hab ich verschlungen, das zweite war auch noch mega spannend und das dritte Buch fand ich so schlecht dass ich die Reihe plötzlich ganz aufgegeben habe. 

Was ist los mit mir, wer kann mir sagen, wie ich Fantasy/Romantasy wieder lieben lerne 😭

I thought we could play the predictive game today (so I can distract you all from my unpopular opinion on this very popular book haha) : 

""The problem with knowledge is...""

The problem with knowledge is power (ooooooh 👀)

Okay, let's keep this short & sweet shall we 🤣 

So I didn't love this one...I'm not even sure I liked it 😅 I enjoyed the first one but Atlas Paradox just completely lost me, I had to force myself to keep reading most of the time. There was a lot of...stuff that wasn't a plot. For me, this book needed something to drive it forward, there was so much meandering and honestly, I was bored throughout most of it. There was a lot of unnecessarily hard words that made it seem overly pretentious at times. I still liked the characters but I can't say I'll be adding the last book to my tbr anytime soon...

Ich bin schon etwas late to the party, oder? Denn Anfang des Jahres habe ich mein erstes Buch von Daniel Schreiber gelesen. Allein. Ausgeliehen von annenas.books - weil ich noch nicht ganz einschätzen konnte, ob mich seine Texte abholen. Ob es zwischen uns funkt. 

Daniel Schreiber schreibt auf sehr persönliche, wissenschaftliche und philosophische Art über das Thema Allein(sein). Wie ist es, wenn man räumlich und gesellschaftlich von anderen getrennt ist? Wenn man in keiner (festen) Partnerschaft ist? Und welche Rolle spielen dabei Freund:innenschaften? Was macht das mit einem? Auf kurze und auf lange Sicht? Und wie hat uns dies auch nochmal während der Pandemie verändert? 

Seine offenen und ehrlichen Worte über die Vor- und Nachteile haben mir sehr gefallen. Doch hab ich es nicht komplett gefühlt. Und ich denke, das ist ok. Jede:r geht anders mit Texten um und jede:r nimmt andere Aspekte für sich mit. Ich kann allerdings absolut verstehen, dass sich viele von euch in dem Buch wiedergefunden haben. 

Ein Buch, das einlädt: zum Innehalten, zum Reflektieren, zum Nachdenken. Und das vor allem den Unterschied zwischen Einsam(keit) und Allein(sein) klärt.

There is just so much in this book that I can’t get on board with - the age difference, the unlikeable characters (every. single. one.), the amount of drugs, the cringey descriptions, awkward dialogue, clichés left right and centre, and the writing style just to name a few 👀.

* My hat. He’s a beret, so I usually speak to him in French

Sometimes you need a physical transformation to pave the way for a MENTAL transformation🙌🏽

The truth is, I didn’t have true self love until I realized I lost 100lbs😳

It wasn’t because of the number on the scale or the size of my jeans…it was because I had committed to making myself the healthiest & happiest version of me…and I freaking did it!!

The physical strength that I gained helped to forge my mental strength because this journey is tough!💯

There’ll be times when you want to quit. Times when you question if you can really do it. Times when you feel like you’re not worth it. 

But, it’s those times when you have to push the hardest! And when you push through and get it done in spite of those thoughts…your confidence and sense of self worth skyrocket 🚀

That’s why I’m excited to commit 21 days to not only focusing on my fitness, but putting the same amount of focus on my nutrition…because that’s still something I struggle with. 

The last time I did this program, I lost 10lbs and felt absolutely amazing, inside and out🤩

21 days doesn’t sound like much, but it could be the very thing you need to get your physical and mental transformation started💕";2023-03-23 00:57:30+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:00.152643+00:00;1;20;en

I hope today, we find a minute to sit with our thoughts and identify just one way in which we have internalized inequality of the genders. We ourselves. Not the world.

17971185878035673;"UNPOPULAR OPINION ALERT!

Dahlia viruses…If you missed my 15-minute soapbox rant on Stories yesterday, I’m recapping it here for you and also giving you, my fellow dahlia enthusiast, a chance to weigh in! (I’ll save the Stories to my highlights as well if you want to check out the whole schpeel.)
Here is my unpopular opinion:
You’ll never have a virus-free dahlia garden. Full stop.
Now your gut reaction to that statement may be, “AMEN SISTER”! Or it may be, “That is an absurd thing to say, you’re absolutely wrong and I won’t buy any tubers from you EVER.” Or it may be, “What the heck is she even talking about?” So let me give you a little bit of background!
If you’re a flower farmer or even a backyard dahlia grower, you’ve likely learned a little something about dahlia viruses. 
What is a dahlia virus? Well, viruses infect plants the same way they do humans. You can be exposed to a virus and get sick, or not (hello Covid). It all depends on your immune system, your health and your genetics. The same goes for plants. A plant can be virus-free and healthy. Or, a plant can be infected with a virus and not show any symptoms. It can be a lush, healthy looking plant, bloom beautifully, and never show a single sign of being sick. Or, it can be stunted, with gnarled yellowing leaves and deformed blooms or no blooms at all—obviously sick. Those sick plants are easy to spot and remove from your garden. OR--a plant can be infected and not show any symptoms until it’s stressed—the same as a human. Water stress, poor soil, poor nutrients, pest pressure, extreme weather—all things that can stress a plant a lower it’s “immune system” so that those virus symptoms appear. 
A few of the plant viruses that infect dahlias are Tomato Spot Wilt Virus, Tobacco Streak Virus, Dahlia Mosaic Virus, amongst others. And viruses have really come to the forefront of the dahlia world over the last 12-18 months as more growers become aware, some people realizing they have shared or purchased infected stock, and all of us sharing more information about dahlia viruses and garden health.

Additional Information: The lyrics are vague, but a common interpretation is that the song is about a girl being bullied by her classmates. The song is considered ""Nightmare Fuel"" due to the disturbing and menacing, yet interesting style of the 3DPV. One other theory people will say is that the girl had an illness, that wasn't contagious but many stayed away from her for it, and she got depressed and one lyric in which she says they can't even die with grace possibly means she forced them to die with her (Source: Vocaloid Wiki)";2023-01-21 17:37:05+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:00.152643+00:00;29;649;en

La lettura è comunque godibile, ma non mi ha convinto, mi è sembrato più che altro un esercizio creativo... Insomma.

Icebreaker took over my feed for quite some time and there were so many rave reviews for it! I was excited to get to this one. I saved up all of my kindle credits to buy this ($11.99 for an ebook 🤯) and was SO disappointed that I did. 

I think this book could have been really good if it was 150 pages shorter. 
I felt so bored and like I was reading the same thing over and over for most of the book. The plot barely moved and I kept asking myself “when are we getting to something important?” 
The FMC was disappointing.. she continued to walk into things she knew would be bad and ignored everyone that tried to help her. 🙄
And there was so. much. sex.. with every character.. don’t get me wrong, I love a good sex scene but it gets a little monotonous when that’s ALL there is for those unnecessary 150 pages. 

This still gets 3 ♥ from me because the plot that was there was good and I liked the overall idea of the book. However, it’s not one I’ll recommend or read again, just a lower end story for me.

So, I used to post Project Diva screenshots a few years ago but was kinda driven away because other screenshotters just, weirded me out. For one thing, they get really picky about reposts which I understand to an extent; if the screenshots feature mods, edits/filters, etc then I definitely see why they want credit but if it doesn’t have any of those then I don’t see the issue. Also, the whole concept of rep modules confuses me. Someone once got mad at me because I “didn’t properly credit” their rep but like,,, it’s a costume? In a game? That anyone can make??? Id never even seen their account before… The system of treating rep mods as their own characters is so bizarre to me. Plus it’s lead to a lot of weird ships, including selfcest (cough cough certain Kaito reps) because the costumes are treated as unique characters even though they’re just clothes for the same base character. I’m just so confused why no one else I’ve talked to understands why that makes me uncomfortable…

17866605581876836;"Hmmm…

Got to admit, Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow is not what I expected it to be. 

Tomorrow x3 follows the lives of video game developers Sam and Sadie over the course of 30 years. This book is described as “not a romance, but a book about love”, and from that description I was expecting a story to move me and make me feel. But I kind of felt nothing whilst reading it 🤷🏾‍♀️ I love it when I feel a deep care for characters, especially in character driven stories but I felt numb. I think that’s partly because gaming is a central theme in this book. In fact, I would say gaming is a main character. So if you don’t like gaming, I wouldn’t recommend this.

However, I can understand why this book has been liked by so many. It explored human relationships and love in a way that is not often portrayed. The kind of love Sadie and Sam had felt deeper than romantic love. I also liked the exploration of disability; it didn’t feel gimmicky or inauthentic.

Maybe I went into this book with high expectations - the book was repeatedly voted best book of 2022 - but unfortunately it missed the mark for me. Yet, I still enjoyed talking about it at book club!

I asked you to tell me about the books everyone loves that you did NOT, and oh boy, did ya’ll deliver. Yesterday’s #UnpopularOpinion Sunday Stories were the biggest yet, and it’s pretty clear you have some very strong feelings about what you read this year.⁣
⁣
What’s most noticeable and ironic is that the books that are blowing away the competition in my “Best Bookstagram Book of 2022” competition are also the same books that have extremely polarizing opinions across the community. For every reader who loved the platonic relationship at the center of TOMORROWx3, there was a reader who thought it was “meh”. For every bookstagrammer who swooned over BOOK LOVERS, there was someone who thought Emily Henry used the word “Sissy” too much. It’s fun to see, and for me, I always tend to lean into the books with the diverging opinions…universal agreement is boring, I want to fight to the death over the books I love (see: me picking LEAVE THE WORLD BEHIND as my favorite book of 2020).⁣
⁣
Anyway, these were the books that received the most criticism yesterday. Love ‘em or hate ‘em, we have certainly spent the last year talking about them. Sound off below. see anything here you loved or hated?⁣

17844784199948374;"🌟BOOK REVIEW🌟

JUST THE NICEST COUPLE 
By Mary Kubica
⭐️⭐️⭐️

Quick read. Short chapters. Multiple POVs. 

I am a huge fan of Mary Kubica's and have been for years, so my expectations were pretty high when I started this book. Unfortunately, it was a little lackluster for me. Unlikable characters, predictable twists, and a few face-palming moments left me slightly underwhelmed. Although it was still an entertaining read, I couldn't relate to any of the characters and found some of their actions to be questionable or unauthentic. 

Overall, this book just felt a little rushed, a little less polished than her other work, which was such a letdown because this was one of my most anticipated reads for this year. 😔

However, that being said, I'm a diehard domestic thriller fan and have loved all of Kubica's previous novels, so I know I'll still be rushing out to read any of her future releases.

Have you read this book? What did you think of it?

Also, what was the last anticipated read that disappointed you?

Si è trattata di una rilettura che sfortunatamente ha riconfermato il mio parere, uno dei più famosi romanzi della letteratura russa è riuscito solo ad annoiarmi e opprimermi. 

💫 Nell'introduzione di Luisa De Nardis la narrazione è paragonata a una pièce teatrale e in effetti gli eventi narati sembrano proprio svolgersi su un palco: con quell'ambientazione ritretta, i personaggi limitati a due che esternano in modo quasi macchiettistico i loro sentimenti. Questa caratteristica fondamentale del romanzo però, nonostante sia molto interessante, è per me il suo più grande difetto perché nelle mie letture prediligo ambientazioni più ""ariose"" e in questo Le Notti Bianche - ambientato interamente di notte, sempre in una zona limitata di San Pietroburgo - è riuscito solo a trasmettermi oppressione e irrealtà. 

🌟I personaggi poi, nel loro tentativo di essere dei perfetti romantici (mossi l'uno dal sogno, l'altra dall'amore), sono finiti con il risultare troppo discostati dalla realtà, il narratore in particolare, al punto che mi sono chiesta se amasse davvero Nasten'ka, o se amasse solo l'idea di lei. Li ho trovati sterili, immaturi, irreali. 

🥀 Questo romanzo è però estremamente popolare, ditemi a voi è piaciuto? Se sì, cosa vi è piaciuto di più? Perchè secondo voi entra nel novero dei capolavori? Sono curiosa di discuterne con voi!

17921236463682842;"Die Vrouwendag gisteren hé…

Die zat mij niet helemaal lekker. Sterker nog, het irriteerde me zelfs op een gegeven moment een beetje.

Daar ga ik dan even op broeden.. Waarom irriteert het mij?

Dat duurde even, maar ik heb ‘m.

Ik vond het zonde dat zo’n dag, zoals vrijwel alles heden ten dage, in het teken van activisme stond, in plaats van in het teken van viering.

Activisme voerde de boventoon. De strijd tegen iets, in plaats van de viering van iets. Tekenend voor deze tijd.

Ik merk dat ik activisme-moe ben. Overal, op elk thema, worden we middels tegenstelling gepolariseerd en daarop ingezet als vrijwillig leger tegen elkaar. We roeien elkaar uit, maar vieren onszelf niet.

Als alle ego’s gehoord en gezien willen worden, laat ieder bij zichzelf beginnen. Door jezelf te zien, en te laten zien. De grootste vorm van activisme. Niet de ander naar je hand zetten, maar jezelf niet veranderen. Vier jezelf!

Dus, sta mij toe met terugwerkende kracht de dag wat te reframen: ik vier mijn vrouw zijn! Wat zoal? Fasten your seatbelts! 💺
• Mijn gevoeligheid
• Mijn cyclus die als innerlijke verslaggever mij elke maand vertelt hoe het met me gaat, en me elke maand een bak wijsheid geeft
• Mijn verzorgende kwaliteiten
• Mijn vrouwelijke lichaam, dat zoveel kan (kind baren, halloooow?! + actiever immuunsysteem dan mannen, ook weer om een eventuele baby te beschermen)
• Mijn sensualiteit
• Mijn vermogen om andermans emotie aan te voelen en daarop te reageren
• De bijzondere band die ik met andere vrouwen kan voelen, als een soort sisterhood

Er zijn zoveel redenen waarom ik trots en blij ben om vrouw te zijn. En dát wil ik vieren! Vier de dag hoe jij het wil, in de rol die jou het beste past, ik wil enkel tussen al het activisme óók dit geluid geven voor de mensen bij wie het resoneert.

En vertel mij, jezelf en anderen vooral wat jij aan jezelf viert? 👏🏻🎉

17962251278510378;"Pointing your finger at yourself sucks.

As someone who has faced numerous challenges and obstacles in both my personal and professional life, I can attest to the fact that the hard truth is often the best teacher. 

It's easy to ignore or brush aside criticism or negative feedback, but it's the moments when we are confronted with the hard truth that we are forced to face our shortcomings and make meaningful changes.

Embracing the hard truth can be uncomfortable and even painful at times, but it's a necessary step towards growth and improvement. Whether it's learning from a mistake, receiving constructive criticism from a colleague, or realizing that our approach to a problem isn't working, the hard truth can be a powerful catalyst for change. 

The next time you're faced with a difficult truth, don't shy away from it. Embrace it, learn from it, and use it to become a better version of yourself. Trust me, the hard truth may be a tough pill to swallow, but it can also be the best teacher you'll ever have.

it kind of is what it says on the tin, but basically I think the reason Kaito in particular sounds so.. froggy. is because people use him far too high. he's a male voice, yet people apply a feminine range to him , resulting in him sounding strained. https://youtu.be/2E6avSiNITo here's a range test with him thats pretty well tuned. I think the strained sound is in part a result of the recordings themselves, they already have that strained sound because naoto Fuga was straining his voice to hit them. as with meiko, I believe something similar is true. songs that feature her lower range tend to sound a lot more natural (ie break it break it and after burner)

Additional Information: KAITO Straight is based on a professional singer. It was a male Japanese vocal that leaned towards genres such as jazz, but due to its high compatibility with the original VOCALOID engine, was easily adaptable to many other genres of music. When KAITO was updated, the voicebank had to be completely re-done with a similar tone to the original, thus some aspects of the vocal have changed in consequential versions. The vocal was also a counter-partner to the MEIKO ""Straight"" (Source: Vocaloid Wiki)

Sicuramente incalzante, vivo nelle immagini, scritto da una penna che sa come trattenere il lettore sulla pagina. Mi è piaciuto molto l'inizio, il dipanarsi della storia, ma a un certo punto iniziano ad accavallarsi fatti e situazioni man mano più improbabili, e diventa impervio seguire il filo logico sottostante. 
Al di là della trama, che mi sembra che a un certo punto vada un po' alla deriva, ho avuto l'impressione di un libro scritto di fretta; per svilupparla bene, una trama così, a mio parere servivano parecchie pagine in più.

18016663072502964;"Unpopular opinion: hiding your content behind tabs or accordions (the ones you click to expand for the details) is bad for your online business.

I know why this is a popular design trend. It looks clean and simple. It makes things more aesthetic and makes your website pretty so it’s not cluttered with content.

And that’s what we’ve been saying right? Don’t clutter your website with too much content, let it breathe, let there be white space!!

Buuuuuut, a clean, modern vibey website also has to be in balance with its job to sell your stuff. This is where some other eComm principles come in:

✨ Trust
✨ Clicks
✨ Frustration

People only buy things online when they feel secure in doing so. Part of building that security with your customers comes from them knowing enough stuff about you or your product to make an informed purchase. You need to give people allll the info.

People don’t click as much as you think they do. Actually, our goal is always to get your shoppers from home to CheckOut with as few clicks as possible. Keep it simple.

Because if it’s not simple, if customers have to expand and collapse a lot of things to find out the info they need to know to buy your stuff, if it’s not easy, they get frustrated. Or bored.

Frustrated customers abandon carts and don’t buy your thing.

Remember ✨a pretty website is not what makes a successful ecommerce business✨

Your customers need you to make it easy, obvious, and safe. 

If you’ve got a lot of content and it’s feeling cluttered, there are other things you can do to make sure customers have a good experience with your website, but hiding your info isn’t a good option.

Your turn. Tell us if you agree or disagree below. Do you click all the tabs? Do you prefer to look at a website that is super minimal? Or do you prefer to be able to scroll to find what you need?

Review: I went into this thinking I would love it. It started great and then I quickly found I preferer the ‘Then” story line astronomically more than the “Now”. This slowed my reading down which is never a good sign. I was annoyed by just wanting to know the story. The attempt at making it a mystery and not giving me interesting hints drove me mad and that was when I started to skim. Overall, I was left just  blah about the entire story.

“UNPOPULAR OPINION”
(Desliza para leer la sinopsis)
🌸Libro “Cosas que nunca dejamos atrás” de Lucy Score
🌸Opinión: Tengo la sensación de que solo he leído cosas magníficas de este libro y soy la única a la que el libro no le ha conquistado🤷🏻‍♀️… Creo que tiene una premisa magnífica y muy potente, junto a una serie de tropes que me encantan, pero a medida que iba leyéndolo no me sentía atrapada en la lectura. El hecho de que todo se resuelva, prácticamente, en las últimas 80 páginas me ha parecido muy precipitado (teniendo en cuenta que tiene +500pags). Además, aspectos bastantes serios me ha parecido que se tomaban muy a la ligera y no se ha ahondado en ellos, resolviéndose todo muy superficialmente y no dándole la importancia que merecían. En cuanto a la pareja principal, ellos me gustan, pero me ha faltado salseo, conversaciones, no sé… no he conectado con la historia entre ellos. Sin embargo… LUCIEN❤️‍🔥 ejem, real que tengo ganas de seguir leyendo los libros por él. Sale en pocas ocasiones pero me han bastado para conectar con él. También quiero destacar el personaje de Wayla; amo a esa niña 😍 y hay un momento que es mi favorito del libro cuando ella señala que “es el momento más feliz de su vida”❤️‍🩹
Finalmente, creo que la pluma de la escritora es buena, ágil y los capítulos cortos ayudan mucho a que el libro no resulte pesado.

The House Across the Lake by Riley Sager 

To spare you from a bunch of swear words, I will make this short. 

Riley, you did me dirty. I strong disliked where you took this book. You created a great storyline and then went completely rogue. I am truly flabbergasted. You have a lot of people who loved this one & for that I am glad, but this is just a no for me.

If it wasn’t for buddy reading this with my husband and friends I would have DNF’d.

What Lies in the Woods

Womp. I know much of bookstagram enjoyed this book, but it didn’t do it for me 🤷🏼‍♀️

I said this in my All The Dangerous Things review and I’ll say it again: the podcast angle isn’t that interesting to me when it doesn’t ultimately impact the story very much. Feels like it’s just thrown in for the sake of it. 

I also guessed a big twist early (was praying I was wrong) and rlyyy did not care for it. From there, I was bored and just hoping for it to redeem itself with something more shocking - it didn’t 😫

Voller Vorfreude durch all die positiven Besprechungen habe ich zu diesem Buch von #taylorjenkinsreid gegriffen und habe mich ehrlich sehr auf die Lektüre gefreut. Nun ja. Am Ende war ich so genervt & entnervt, dass ich es 90 Seiten vor Schluss sogar abgebrochen habe. Nervige, unsympathische Charaktere, eine kaum vorhandene, nichts sagende, vorhersehbare, plätschernde Handlung und (auch darauf hatte ich mich eigentlich auch gefreut) eine letztendlich sehr nervige Umsetzung des Ganzen in Form von Interviews. Ich bin wirklich ratlos. Könnt ihr mir erklären, was da bei mir schiefgegangen ist? Gibt es gar noch andere Menschen hier, die es auch nicht mochten? Dieses Buch konnte keinerlei (positive) Gefühlsregungen bei mir wecken. Irgendwann hab ich nur noch überflogen, geblättert.

This book pissed me off and may very well be the most awful book I’ve ever read - besides Behind Her Eyes. Annoying ass characters doing stupid shit. Excruciatingly slow. The REPETITION. I know several scenes were reiterated or repeated multiple times.I felt like I was going around in circles. Like, didn’t I just hear that? Did I accidentally rewind? Then I’d hear it AGAIN!!!

The story was very amateur. How did she go from Local Gone Missing to this? Midway, I was literally screaming get to the point already?!! Absolutely nothing happened. Just chapter after chapter of questions? What, where, did I, did you…. And for goodness sake the whole “did I close the door, cut off the alarm “ spiel is played TF outtttt! Leave it in 2002!

There was one tiny saving grace, which was the twist at the very end and what really happened, but then I got mad all over again at some last minute choices that were made.

This was an extreme disappointment and there are many great reviews. I have no idea why, but it’s a .5 ⭐️⤴️ for me, an epic fail. Now I’m rethinking my feelings about Local Woman Missing… did I really enjoy it? Was it just the hype? Was it really good? Because after JTNC, aint no wayyyyy…

I think the hype surrounding certain big names is a prime example of how some folks can get the spotlight off mediocrity, not even trying. And so many worthy, talented writers who get no shine because their name isn’t hyped. I’m pissed off again. I’m tempted to tag her in this wretched review but I’ll just leave it here.

Book: A Court of Silver Flames
Author: Sarah J. Maas
Genre: Fantasy
Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️

As I wrote this review I ended up dropping my rating from 4 to 3 stars. Giving this book “only” a three star rating feels like an unpopular opinion! This is the last (so far) book in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series and revolves around Nesta and Cassian. I didn’t love it. I really wanted to, I loved the rest of the series, but this book was basically smut with a side of fantasy. Not my cup of tea! All the other books in the series were not even close to being this steamy so this book felt like it was written by a totally different author! If there are more books to release in the future, I’m honestly not sure I’ll read them because I’m sure they’ll more closely resemble this book. 

I didn’t love Nesta and it took me awhile to even like her in this book, I found her to be whiny and immature. The whole plot line was all over the place, half the time I was confused about what was going on, it felt very scatter brained. And to be honest, I found myself not really caring about what was going on. 

What I loved about this book: how Feyre and Rhys were still a large part of the story and I loved how both Cassian and Azriel became front and center. I liked how the book ended. 

This book was ridiculously long and felt like it could’ve been split into two books with two different story lines, like I already said the whole book felt very scatter brained to me. 

Have you read this series? I know I’m definitely in the minority on this book.";2023-03-06 14:40:28+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:02.007768+00:00;15;52;en

After seeing this book all over bookstagram and seeing it was 99p on Kindle I thought I might as well see what the hype was all about …

This book is primarily about gaming but it is also about people, friendship, love and grief👾💖

As much as I enjoyed the original storyline and the character development within this book I sometimes I did feel myself skim reading over the gaming jargon and some other parts of the book, just to get it finished🫢🤦‍♀️

I did enjoy the story overall but I personally don’t get the hype, which I know I’m in the minority saying that🫣

unpopular opinion alert 🚨 

Oh man…… Guys. I really, really wanted to love this. It’s literally everywhere and everyone seems to love it. But as I sat down to try to write out some thoughts for a “review”, I realized how much I didn’t like it and changed my rating down a star to a 2. 

This was just not for me at all. All of the characters are unlikeable. They were toxic as shit. And I know the whole premise isn’t that they’re supposed to end up besties and  start a Power Rangers gang, but come on. Some slight niceties every once in awhile would be okay. The only character I didn’t hate was Dalton, who is probably the most minor character of the novel? 

Also, literally nothing happens. It’s basically almost 400 pages of separate conversations between pairs of characters and no actual plot progression. It was boring and clunky and not for me. Not to “yuck anyone’s yum” as the trolls like to say, but this was just not my bag. Needless to say I will probably not be reading the sequel. 😅

I am working my way through my TJR backlog and thought this bright beauty (yes I splurged on the UK cover) would be a great vacation read. 

A modern-day Sliding Doors (such a good old school Gwenyth Paltrow movie!!) featuring parallel realities: what happens if Hannah goes home with her old love one night and what happens if she doesn't?!

This is a premise that spoke to me. We have all been in a situation at some point in our lives where we wonder what would have happened if we had made different choices. How would our lives look?

⚠️ UNPOPULAR OPINION alert here...

So this book was kind of... depressing? 

Apparently, for Hannah, both paths would look really really messy and only get better at the very end 😬

For me, the highlight and real love story of this novel was the unbreakable bond between Hannah and her BFF Gabby. And as I have come to expect from TJR, both women were written incredibly well.

This was just... maybe a bit too much of a downer for me (especially on the beach). I also clearly favoured one storyline over the other as one didn't sit as well with me.

Unfortunately, not a hit for me....⭐️⭐️⭐️💫

Unpopular Opinion: 😅

Personally, this one just didn’t hit for me like it did for so many others. Sure, it starts off strong, then I feel like all the political stuff was just too much. At one point I started to feel like nothing was really happening. I didn’t love it. I didn’t hate it. I’ve also already forgotten it so there’s that too.. 

Now I will say that I do believe this book makes for a great book club discussion where everyone can share their perspectives/beliefs… so in this aspect, I thought it was great. 😌 

I think I’d say ⭐️⭐️💫 (2.5/5) OR ⭐️⭐️⭐️

Lange nicht mehr dabei gewesen, vielen Dank für die Nominierung kueck_andreas 

Ich mag Buchverfilmungen in der Regel nicht besonders. Und auch insgesamt sehe ich wenig bis gar nicht fern. Mit Netflix o.ä. kann ich nicht dienen. 

Diese vier Bücher sind auch schon vor längerer Zeit verfilmt worden, 2 habe ich gesehen, gelesen sind alle 4.

🍿MARY POPPINS von P. L. Travers: eines meiner liebsten Kinderbücher. Ich liebe auch den Film (und den Soundtrack!), aber der ist völlig anders als die Vorlage. Der Film hat 1964 5 Oscars gewonnen!!!

🍿HARRY POTTER (insgesamt) von J. K. Rowling: Ich mag die Bücher, die Hörbücher, die Filme. Verfilmt zwischen 2001 und 2011

🍿SHINING von Stephen King: Heute beendet (weitestgehend als Hörbuch): als Film bestimmt gruselig,  als Buch eher langweilig, unlogisch und auf billige Schockeffekte aus. Aber Jack Nicholson war garantiert die perfekte Besetzung. So, das war gleichzeitig meine Rezension dazu😂 Der Film ist so alt wie ich, Jahrgang 1980.

🍿WAS VOM TAGE ÜBRIGBLIEB von Kazuo Ishiguro: gelesen Anfang März im #buddyread mit xy_ungelesen. Gut formuliert, vielleicht spannend, wenn man sich für Silberpolitur interessiert. Den Film kenne ich kaum, hatte beim Lesen aber ständig Anthony Hopkins und Emma Thompson vor Augen 😄. Auch dazu habe ich jetzt genug gesagt🤭. Verfilmt 1993, zwar nominiert für 8 Oscars, aber leer ausgegangen.

17970299552218393;"I hate to admit it, but this is a DNF for me. I had high hopes for this book, but I couldn’t bring myself to really care about it.

The world-building is lovely and detailed. I felt it was well-fleshed-out even though I didn’t really understand the countries and conflicts there (I know the conflicts are based off real events in Asia, but having little base knowledge on this, it was hard to get my bearings here).

My bigger problem was that I didn’t care about the characters, much less what they’re fighting for. Rin is childish and brash, her main motive to gain POWER, though as far as I’ve gotten I don’t see why it’s such a drive for her. I like that she is not a perfectly moral human, but she doesn’t have enough character to redeem herself in my eyes. 

So I stopped about halfway. I wasn’t enjoying it. I don’t want to force myself to read something I don’t enjoy and then feel bitter about it later. It just wasn’t for me.

But I still can’t wait to read Yellowface coming out in a couple of months. 😊

✨Icebreaker by Hannah Grace✨

Quick synopsis: Anastasia (Stassie) is a figure skater working hard to make Team USA. Nathan is a hockey player on their college team. Something happens to one of their university’s ice rinks and the figure skaters and hockey players are forced to share a rink to practice on. Their forced close proximity leads to hook ups and friendships, etc.

My thoughts: I actually didn’t finish this one but feel bad rating it even less. It wasn’t bad, I just…got bored.🫣The characters were cute and the spice was THERE. But what was the plot? Who knows? Not me.

18351288661024132;"Das Lachen der Pinguine – eine Abbruchrezension

Mit dem Abbruch von Büchern tu ich mich immer schwer, erst recht, wenn es sich dabei um ein Rezensionsexemplar handelt. In diesem Fall habe ich mich jedoch letztlich dafür entschieden, warum, möchte ich hier erläutern, denn ich habe einige Kritikpunkte und ansonsten scheint es auf Instagram bisher tatsächlich nur sehr positive Meinungen dazu zu geben.

zuckerberlin hat mir dankenswerterweise ein liebevolles Paket zugeschickt, in dem neben tollen Goodies auch dieses Romandebüt von Arabella Meran enthalten war, auf das ich mich sehr gefreut habe: Wie schon auf dem Cover zu lesen geht es um die erste Frau in der Antarktis in der Geschichtsschreibung, Caroline Mikkelsen. Zuvor hatte ich noch nie von ihr gehört und war gespannt, in dieser Romanbiografie über sie und ihren unkonventionellen Lebensweg zu lesen. Doch nach 150 Seiten (30 %) legte ich das Buch zur Seite.

Bis dahin war noch immer nichts Großartiges geschehen: Caroline war noch nicht einmal mit Kapitän Mikkelsen verheiratet, geschweige denn auf dem Weg in die Antarktis oder gar dabei, im Anschluss ihre eigene Nähschule zu eröffnen, wie auf dem Klappentext und in der Einführung zum historischen Hintergrund zu lesen.
Für mich persönlich lag ein zu großer Fokus auf der Liebesgeschichte, anstatt auf der Expedition, auf deren Beschreibungen von Reiseerfahrungen ich mich vor allem gefreut hatte. Natürlich mag diesbezüglich noch einiges auf den verbleibenden 330 Seiten folgen, doch gibt es auch noch einen anderen Handlungsstrang, der 1995 spielt und ebenfalls Raum einnimmt.
Nun mag dies noch eine sehr subjektive Präferenz sein und an einer falschen Erwartungshaltung meinerseits liegen, doch war dies leider nicht mein einziges Problem mit der Lektüre.
Mein Hauptkritikpunkt ist, dass die Geschichte bzw. der Rahmen immer wieder auffallend unauthentisch ist.

17945672135478158;"✨ RESEÑA | Dance of Thieves de Mary E. Pearson [3.5/5⭐]

🇪🇸 𝐄𝐧 𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐚ñ𝐨𝐥 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐨 '𝐁𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐝𝐞 𝐥𝐚𝐝𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐬' con crossbookslibros

Dances of thieves es el inicio de una bilogía que si bien es lenta, no es tan de fantasía y tiene un romance que a mi parecer le ha faltado, también tiene una ambientación que me encanta y unos personajes que me han dado justo en las debilidades.

Kazi es una ladrona convertida a soldado que viaja a otro reino en busca de un fugitivo. Allí se encuentra con Jase, el jefe de la zona. Un encuentro enemies-to-lovers maravilloso, un forced proximity en los que se quedan juntos encadenados (*fangirling*) r y un juego de juntos pero sin conocerse y con secretos que me ha enganchado.

Kazi la he adorado. Es la típica que ha tenido una infancia pésima, que se convierte en una hábil ladrona y ahora va tal que de infiltrada Y YO COMPRO. Es inteligente y me gusta como se las gastas, pero sobre todo gusta ese pasado crudo y cómo es una buena soldado pero hay deslices emocionales. Por su parte, Jase adoro por ser jefe de familia, por ser el protector y representar otro tipo de cultura y modo de vida así como tener siempre una debilidad humana que ♥ . El rollo de que a veces vayan modo mafia me mola y me he quedado con más ganas de su familia.

El romance es rápido y con un juego extraño que de normal no me hubiera convencido pero partiendo de la base que tienen los personajes y cayendo ellos en 100 páginas, me he sorprendido encantada con todos los acontecimientos que pasaba. Tiene ese algo por cómo son los personajes, por los secretos que se esconden y estaba deseando descubrir que me tenía living.

En cuanto a trama y mundo es lenta pero disfrutable, ha tenido momentos en los que no he podido soltar el libro. Tiene una trama atrayente de secretos y un mundo que si bien no se expande en profundidad, da lo suficiente para dar una ambientación gustosa.

No siento que sea el libro del año pero sí que lo he disfrutado. Eso sí, no me ha dejado especialmente curiosa por el siguiente libro, no siento que quede tanto más (ese extra final fue por poner algo más) bien podría haber cubierto todo aquí.

Selen vs popular opinion 🤷🏻‍♀️

I loved the Kiss Quotient (5 🌟), enjoyed the Bride Test (4 🌟) and was disappointed with the Heart Principle (3 🌟) , not sure why it is going downhill...

This book has many heavy topics: autism spectrum, burn out, artist block, loss, cancer... If you take off all the sex words and pages, it is actually a very strong book. I admired the author for sharing something so close to her own life but I wish the heavy and light were not mixed the way they were. In my opinion, the author used sex the lighten the book but it just made me annoyed as I kept getting detached from the story and and I ended up skipping all those pages... I could have related to so many things in this book but I just couldn't get into it.

So maybe you saw in my stories , I decided to give in and read Bridgerton, as I am scared to pick up any other book from my TBR. 100 pages in the first book, so far so good.

I finally gave in and read this unhinged book. It's been sitting on the shelf for over a year. I knew it wasn't for me but I had the know what the fuss was about. 

Well, there you have it. I hated it. 

Was it bingable? 100% 
Did I sort of enjoy the twist at the end? Heck, yes
Do I recommend it to anyone? I need to know the person really well in order to to that.

There are triggers and it is impossible to talk about them without spoilers. I am going to list them in the comment section. 

If you've seen my stories you'd have seen my comment about the number of on page sex scenes in this book. I thought this book was a romantic thriller. I didn't find anything romantic in this book. Open door sex scenes doesn't make a book a romance. That's my opinion.

Okay, end of rant/review. I haven't rated the book yet. Because I honestly don't know how. I am just glad it is over.

Do you trust your gut when it comes to books? Do you steer clear of the ones you know won't be for you? Or do you let your curiosity take the wheel? Tell me one book that was a wrong book for you. I'll go first: Betty, The Push, My Dark Vanessa

Secluded Cabin Sleeps Six By LIsa Unger 

This book was trying to do way too much. 

There were so many alternating POVs, some didn't even need to be in the book.  The premise of Mako and his wife Liza planning a weekend getaway for themselves, Mako's sister Hannah, her husband and their friend Cricket and her boyfriend was a fantastic setup, I thought a lot was going to happen, but then we got hung up on a bunch of rando characters, in completely different times, places and some plot points weren't even resolved. 

It was also repetitive and the focus on DNA and sharing it with registries, for geneology purposes almost felt like an ad.  The reason I kept reading was because it truly thought something wild was going to happen, turns out I was just wildly disppointed. 

QOTD: At what point would you decide to leave the creepy cabin your staying at? At the first sight of anything strange, trust your gut or just wait it out and hope it all works out well???

Ughhh I wanted to love this one so much! 😫 In fact, I really enjoyed the first half. It was jumpy, spooky and had a good bit of depth. The story was rolling right along, and I just wanted to know their secrets; to keep reading.

BUT…fast forward to the last 100 pages or so. It lost me. The story became less and less intriguing, and kind of widely “out there”. I continued to picture this book as a movie and the second half would’ve made me roll my eyes and turn it off. Without giving too much away, I think it was a rushed & disappointing ending. I would’ve liked to see a little more haunted realism.

This is my first book by Grady Hendrix and I loved his writing! I will definitely read more of his because he is an easy read. I saw the hype in this one & had a lot of hope, but it was a miss for me.

When Louise finds out her parents have died, she dreads going home. She doesn’t want to leave her daughter with her ex and fly to Charleston. She doesn’t want to deal with her family home, stuffed to the rafters with the remnants of her father’s academic career and her mother’s lifelong obsession with puppets and dolls. She doesn’t want to learn how to live without the two people who knew and loved her best in the world.

Most of all, she doesn’t want to deal with her brother, Mark, who never left their hometown, gets fired from one job after another, and resents her success. Unfortunately, she’ll need his help to get the house ready for sale because it’ll take more than some new paint on the walls and clearing out a lifetime of memories to get this place on the market. 

But some houses don’t want to be sold, and their home has other plans for both of them…

Miał być post o zupełnie innej książce, ale nadal nie potrafię zebrać słów i ułożyć ich w to, co chce przekazać. Więc dziś będzie o...

📖""Zamknij wszystkie drzwi""

Przyznam szczerze, że początek wydał mi się trochę.. banalny, nierealny, ale zaufałam polecejce Pauli ruderecenzuje. Z czasem wszystko zaczęło się zgrywać.

No bo umówmy się. Masz dwadzieścia kilka lat, tracisz robotę, twój związek się kończy i musisz na nowo poukładać swoje życie. Więc kiedy trafia Ci się oferta, w której za zamieszkanie w luksusowym apartamencie i opiekowanie się nim dostajesz wielokrotność normalnej wypłaty powinna zapalić się czerwona lampka. Coś tu nie gra.

Jules zamieszkała w apartamencie w Barhtolomew, a coraz dziwniejsze zasady zaczęły w pewnym sensie zacieniać jej pętlę na szyi. Aż w środku nocy wybiega z budynku prosto pod koła samochodu.

Uwielbiam!
Uwielbiam, kiedy podejrzenia rzucane są na kolejne osoby, kiedy tak wiele czynników się zmieni, a nie dostrzega się szczegółów, porządnie zamaskowanych. Budowanie napięcia od pierwszych stron, by dowiedzieć się, co doprowadziło do tego finału.

Wiele osób porównywało ten tytuł do ""Wróć przed zmrokiem"" i wielu opiniach ""Zamknij wszystkie drzwi"" wypada gorzej. W moim przypadku jest zupełnie odwrotnie!

Comin’ at you this Monday morning with an *unpopular opinion!!* 

This book has taken over my feed since it was published and I CANNOT understand why it’s so popular. I literally dragged myself through this one. 

Miscommunication. Enemies to enemies to enemies to instalovers. Single bed. Workplace romance. Ughhh just pick ONE. 

I don’t even want to go into details because I don’t want to think about this book for one more second 😅
Basically, just read The Hating Game and skip this one. 

The Spanish Love Deception: it was indeed about a Spanish woman and I was deceived into thinking this was worth my time.

17965718003148925;"TOMORROW AND TOMORROW AND TOMORROW 📚 by Gabrielle Zevin 

“We are all living, at most, half of a life, she thought. There was the life you lived, which consisted of the choices you made. And then, there was the other life, the one that was the things you hadn’t chosen.”

Two friends — often in love, but never lovers — come together as creative partners in the world of video game design, where success brings them fame, joy, tragedy, duplicity, and, ultimately, a king of immortality 👾 

Initially, I had no interest in this book when it first released. Then as I saw the constant buzz, rave reviews, and many awards won, I became curious. I added this book as my free BOTY finalist add on. Let me just say, I’m definitely in the minority here when I say this book is extremely overrated 🫣. 

The characters were pretty insufferable. There were sooo many slow parts, it felt like a snoozefest at times. The writing was a bit pretentious. A bit too techy for me. I think the book could’ve been cut by at least 150 pages, because I did enjoy the story at its core. Overall it was a good story, but nothing to write home about 🤷🏻‍♀️

⁣
My last book of September was A Merry Little Meet Cute, by Julie Murphy and Sierra Simone. It features an adult film star and a boy band musician who somehow get cast in a Hallmark-style Christmas movie on the Hope Channel. As they begin filming sparks ignite. With quirky characters and careers in the balance, can love find a way?⁣
⁣
Unfortunately, this book was not for me. All the elements of this story, Christmas, steam, and fun characters should have been stellar, but the pacing and general tone felt off to me. I don’t think it was a bad book by any means, just not the one for me. I have seen nothing but amazing reviews so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I guess I am the hair in the Happy Meal on this one.⁣

Elle ist Anfang 50 und glücklich verheiratet mit Peter. Sie haben drei Kinder und machen jedes Jahr Urlaub im „Papierpalast“, einem von Elles Großvater notdürftig gebauten Haus am See. Meist sind auch ihr Jugendfreund Jonas und seine Frau Gina mit von der Partie. Elle und Jonas lernten sich als Kinder kennen und verliebten sich später ineinander. Jahrzehntelang teilen sie ein schwerwiegendes Geheimnis, das es Elle unmöglich macht, mit Jonas zusammen zu sein. Dennoch beginnt der Roman damit, dass sie ihren Ehemann mit Jonas betrügt. 
Da gibt es eine große Liebe, gegen die Elle sich wehrt, weil sie mit einer schrecklichen Erinnerung verbunden ist, von der sie Abstand gewinnen will. Das hätte ich vielleicht noch nachvollziehen können, vielleicht. Und dann, eines Tages, gibt sie dennoch plötzlich nach. Aber das geschieht für mich so ausschließlich auf das Körperliche reduziert, dass ich es nicht ernstnehmen konnte. Ich konnte auch keiner der Figuren wirklich nahekommen. Peter fand ich gar nicht so sympathisch und wunderbar, wie Elle ihn beschreibt (das mag sicher auch mit an der Übersetzung liegen, aber wer nennt denn seine Frau noch zum Spaß „Weib“?) und Jonas spielt mit seiner Frau Gina ein ganz schön falsches Spiel. Wahrscheinlich kann ich auch einfach keine Liebesgeschichten (mehr) lesen 😅. Die haben mir besser gefallen als ich da noch einen Mangel hatte 😀. 
Andererseits möchte ich auch darauf aufmerksam machen, dass es gar kein so sommerlich leichter Roman ist, wie Cover und Marketing vermuten lassen. Wenn man sich von Themen wie Untreue oder sexueller Gewalt getriggert fühlt, ist das sicher nicht die richtige Urlaubslektüre.
Der Schreibstil hat mir übrigens gut gefallen, er war leicht, aber nicht trivial. Auch die Spannung wurde konstant aufrecht erhalten, ich wollte schon gerne wissen, was geschehen ist und auch wie es ausgeht.

𝙼𝚒𝚗𝚒 𝙱𝚘𝚘𝚔 𝚁𝚎𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚠: ⭐️⭐️/5 

𝚂𝚞𝚖𝚖𝚊𝚛𝚢: 

Lucy Hutton and Joshua Templeman hate each other. Not dislike. Not begrudgingly tolerate. Hate. And they have no problem displaying their feelings through a series of ritualistic passive aggressive maneuvers as they sit across from each other, executive assistants to co-CEOs of a publishing company. Lucy can’t understand Joshua’s joyless, uptight, meticulous approach to his job. Joshua is clearly baffled by Lucy’s overly bright clothes, quirkiness, and Pollyanna attitude.

Now up for the same promotion, their battle of wills has come to a head and Lucy refuses to back down when their latest game could cost her her dream job…But the tension between Lucy and Joshua has also reached its boiling point, and Lucy is discovering that maybe she doesn’t hate Joshua. And maybe, he doesn’t hate her either. Or maybe this is just another game.

I get that the song has only been around for a week and that it is a Vocametal song, but this producer (who I think goes by the name of Midorigame) has been releasing many bangers over the two years they’ve been a part of the scene, and some of his stuff is really cool, but it doesn’t get enough recognition. What I like about this song especially is that it’s like Kinoshita’s music in a sense where it’s literally just about Rin wanting to be an Idol with high pitches and cutesy tuning, with instrumentals that really feel like they came out of Utsu P’s Galapagos album. It’s sounds super reminiscent of Utsu P’s older works and the video just makes it feel so authentic like “Ramen Shop Grotesque”. A really cool song more people should check out, especially since it has only 2.3K views yet sounds so good, but honestly as it being one of the producer’s more viewed videos, I’m glad it’s this one

VERITY - COLLEEN HOOVER

(Pls check trigger warnings online)

⭐️⭐️/5🫠

Guys, no no no no no no...

Tbh I think my expectations affected my reading experience, given that so many booksta people love this one and found it mindblowing.

I found Colleen Hoover's writing lacked subtlety and it was repetitive. There were also redundant sex scenes that I felt were only there to make the character appear more shocking. The MC then did call Verity out for all the seggs in the manuscript (but that doesn't mean I forgive CoHo for subjecting me to it all, as the sheer amount DID.NOT.ADD.TO.THE.STORY.). 

I would've liked more action and events happening in real time in the house, given that the whole book is set there. I also didn't see the point of some things that were included (the event at the start of the book and MC's condition) - pure shock factor irrelevant things. By the end I did not care manuscript or letter or anything, I just wanted the characters out of my life. I've read so many stunning thrillers over the past couple of years (e.g. by Lisa Jewell and Christian White) and that might have also affected my experience. 

I was afraid Colleen Hoover might not be for me and I'm afraid I might be right. I do have It Ends With Us on my Kobo and I am keen to try reading Heart Bones maybe possibly. 

In saying that, I finished this book in 2 days which shows that it is very readable and compelling in that I wanted to know what happened in the end. Was it worth it? No. I Also DID like the way she played with the idea of manuscript vs letter, and there were some scenes that were fun spooky just sad they didn't lead up to much at the end.

Diese literarische Nabelschau von Autor:innen - deren Leben mich vermutlich nicht wirklich interessierte, würden sie nicht gerade dafür gefeiert, dass sie eben dieses erzählerisch aufarbeiten - rührt dann doch recht wenig in mir. Weder wollte ich wissen, wie es bei Tove weitergeht, noch hat es mich sprachlich so beeindruckt, dass ich über ersteres hinwegsehen konnte. Kein #tovelesen für mich also.

17937231920166853;"THRILLER THURSDAY! 🍷

What’s your favorite Riley Sager? 

I wanna start the review off by saying I’ve loved Riley Sager’s books in the past (Home Before Dark is my faaaave!) I’m not giving up on him! This seems to be a polarizing book so I think if your interested still give it a try! 

Mini synopsis: an alcoholic woman watches her neighbors from across the lake & one day she notices the wife has gone missing. She of course thinks the husband did it & involves herself & the police to find out what happened.

Now…. My biggest problem is that we’re meant to believe that Casey, who drinks far too much every night, is the unreliable narrator. However, all of her actions aren’t unreliable. What she sees when she’s spying on her neighbors are actually happening. I never doubted what she saw, not once. There wasn’t any other perspectives telling her any differently 🤷🏻‍♀️

What Riley Sager does best is the double twist! I didn’t mind the twist, however I know there are a lot of people who love it! I appreciate that he went there, but by the time it happened, I honestly didn’t care anymore. I literally don’t think I ever got past her “unreliableness” 😂 and the audiobook narrator made Casey sound like she was wayyyyy older than she was. I’m thinking she was probably late 20s early 30s, but the narrator made her feel like she was 50 or 60! 

While this might be my least favorite of his books, I will continue to pick up & get excited for his releases! I think he has great concepts, but this didn’t work for me! (& that’s okay! It’s working for a lot of people!!)

Shameless plug: I ranked all of his books best to worst on my TikTok if you wanna see how the rest fall!

17979048209060419;"Alright, I’m here to spill the tea ☕️ 
This book was not it. What we are not about to do is normalize pedophilia and market it as a romance (which is what this is classified as on StoryGraph). This story was upsetting and disturbing, but I was able to stick with it in hopes that someone—any character—would step in and help Wavy, the main character. Instead, nearly all characters turned a blind eye to Wavy’s victimization, and the couple of characters who actually did try to intervene were written as villains. 

I know, I know, the “I’m just as real as you” moment was meant to speak to the story as a whole and the reader, as well as the character addressed. But Wavy was a traumatized child with obvious mental health issues; she can still be (and is) a victim, even if she doesn’t feel like one because she has no frame of reference for what love and security feels like after a lifetime of abuse and neglect.

I’m fine with a book leaving readers uncomfortable if that’s the point, but I don’t think it was here. All the 5-star reviews I read were praising this unconventional “love story.” Nope. Hard pass. There are ways to be taboo and edgy, and this isn’t it.

The Simple Wild by K.A. Tucker 

Format: Physical Book 
Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️💫/5

✈️ I had such high hopes for this one… probably too high tbh! This book was hard for me to get through. I was kinda bored, and to be fair, romance is a very hit-or-miss genre for me, but I had bigger issues, which I will get to, but first I will say the last few chapters were SO good and the ending was perfection. 

✈️ Ok issue one: Jonah was so mean. I usually like enemies-to-lovers, but in this one, I felt like they were enemies because Jonah was straight up a jerk to Calla. I wasn’t able to totally get over that. I felt like he had no respect for her. He is constantly belittling her and shaming her for her interests in fashion and makeup and even for needing soy milk when she has a dairy allergy? 

✈️ Issue two: I thought it seemed like a lot of the burden of the failed father/daughter relationship was placed on the daughter? 

✈️ Simon was everything. I want a Simon story. 

✈️ The ending actually helped resolve or partially resolve some of these issues for me and bumped this up to a 3.5⭐️, so that’s good, but overall I don’t think I enjoyed this one enough to continue the series. I’m sad I didn’t love this one because I really wanted to. If you’re interested in reading this, don’t let me dissuade you because I think I’m the minority.

I’ve got an unpopular opinion on this one 😬

I had really high expectations for this book, but unfortunately it fell really short for me. It honestly felt like a teenager who just learned about cuss words wrote this book. There were SO MANY cuss words in this book that it was childish, and so many places where they just didn’t fit in. 

Also this whole thing with the coffee…. The amount of time coffee was discussed in this book was ridiculous lol. 

Overall, this book had so much potential but it was written too poorly for my taste.

17845120463923832;"The song of achilles ~ a somewhat controversial review

From time to time I'll read a hyped book and come away wondering if  I read the same book as everyone else, and this is one of those times. I'm not a fantasy or a Greek mythology girlie but I was assured by many a review that I didn't need to know anything of the mythology, but I can't help but feel it would've been helpful. 

The biggest issue I have with this is the way it's written.  It takes quite a while for the story to feel like it was going anywhere, and I felt the focus of the writing was on the wrong thing. Yes, it can be argued that the writing about the setting etc is beautiful, but I don't think it served any actual purpose. All it did was attempt to obfuscate the fact that the reader is kept at arm's length from Achilles and Patroclus the entire time.  It is told that they become friends, but this is not shown with enough depth, and such I felt no connection to either of them.

This book really highlighted that I don't much care for exposition for the sake of it. I want the focus on the characters, their thoughts/emotions/struggles and this did not deliver on that front. Because of this misplaced focus, the pacing was glacial at the start and only sort of picked up in the last 100 pages, and I was ultimately left disappointed.

 I do appreciate what the ending was trying to do, but by that point it was lost on me as I simply did not care for either of them, because I'd not been given a reason to care. For a book that's meant to cause tears/sobbing, my eyes had never been drier (and I've tried using contact lenses).

I'm happy for you if you enjoyed this but this was not for me at all.

ok pls no one kick me off the internet for this opinion, but this book just did not truly do it for me. I would say it was probably about a 3/3.5 star book. I’m so happy that so many people love this book so dearly and also that I read it so I can at least understand the heart ache of the end (no literally…I was crying despite not being fully obsessed with the story) I do still want to give this authors other work CIRCE a chance because, as mentioned, the writing was gorg💖

At twenty-two years old, Sydney is enjoying a great life: She’s in college, working a steady job, in love with her wonderful boyfriend, Hunter, and rooming with her best friend, Tori. But everything changes when she discovers that Hunter is cheating on her—and she’s forced to decide what her next move should be.

Soon, Sydney finds herself captivated by her mysterious and attractive neighbor, Ridge. She can't take her eyes off him or stop listening to the passionate way he plays his guitar every evening out on his balcony. And there’s something about Sydney that Ridge can’t ignore, either. They soon find themselves needing each other in more ways than one.

17985847747760598;"„Das dritte Licht“ von Claire Keegan ist mein erstes gelesenes Buch auf meinem neuen e-Reader von pocketbook_de. Ausgesucht habe ich mir das Buch wegen dem Cover. Dieses Gesicht hat mich einfach eingefangen. (Und was für ein Glück, dass das Ink Pad Color Farben darstellen kann 😎.)

Werbung | Rezensionsexemplar

Die Erzählung startet, als ein Vater seine junge Tochter bei einem Ehepaar abgibt. Sie soll dortbleiben, die Familie des Mädchens lebt in ärmlichen Verhältnissen, die Mutter ist wieder schwanger, das Geld reicht kaum. Das Paar, John und Edna Kinsella, nehmen das Mädchen bei sich auf und bringen dem Kind eine Wärme entgegen, die es zunächst nicht fassen kann, die es nicht kennt. Aber es gibt auch ein Geheimnis, welches einen Schatten über das friedliche Zusammenleben wirft.

Ich glaube, meine Meinung zu dem Buch fällt wohl in die Kategorie #unpopularopinion. Die kurze Erzählung ist grundsätzlich gut, keine Frage. Sie erzeugt Atmosphäre und ein Stimmungsbild, welches die liebevolle Umgebung und die Gefühle des Mädchens widerspiegelt. Es steht viel zwischen den Zeilen, der Text soll Emotionen durch das Ungesagte auslösen. Aber leider war es für mich zu wenig. Das Buch konnte mich nicht so richtig packen, ich habe nicht so sehr mitgelebt und gelitten, wie es die Erzählung verlangen würde. Ich habe das Ganze mit einer gewissen Distanz gelesen und das ist schade. Das Buch hat gerade mal 100 Seiten und da ist man entweder von Beginn an dabei oder eben nicht. Es ist zu kurz, dass es einen später noch einzufangen könnte.

Woran es liegt, dass ich nicht so reingekommen bin, kann ich gar nicht sagen. Vielleicht war mir die Geschichte zu schwarz weiß oder das Geheimnis zu offensichtlich. 

Insgesamt sicher ein Buch, das vielen gefallen kann, für mich hat es nicht richtig gepasst.

17954698202375520;"This beautiful leopard is in captivity, through no fault of her own, she is forced to live behind bars and denied all her natural behaviours. She is an obligate carnivore which means she must eat other animals and depends on humans to feed her.
.
As a vegan I totally understand that no one life is more or less important than the next. Some vegans would claim she needs to be euthanised as taking her life would save the lives of the many others she would need to eat – yet, left alone in the wild we would argue that’s nature, she needs to kill to survive.
.
As vegans, how can we advocate killing her? Yet killing other animals to feed her implies that those animals have less moral worth. 
.
It goes without saying that humans have created this predicament. At what point do we stop interfering, stop deciding who lives or dies? If all the cages were emptied, the world would hopefully restore some sort of natural order.

Thoughts?

As a result of their vicious lies, Black men have been unjustly incarcerated and murdered at alarming rates.

Knowing all of the pain and trauma that Black families have endured from this. Why do they continue to run to their arms and equate them with success?

17946285248402754;"🎥The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo 🎥

Firstly, I want to state that this isn’t my usual type of read but it’s been recommended to me a LOT. I thought February was the perfect time to read Evelyn Hugo at long last; it’s been sitting on my cart for a long time.

For those that haven’t read this one, it’s a story about Evelyn Hugo, a glamorous film star, and the secret love she has for her friend Celia. The story follows Evelyn and the seven men she marries in an attempt to cover up that she’s bisexual and the love of her life is a woman. 

I’m going for the unpopular opinion on this one. I found the book to be quite shallow and egotistical and I wasn’t entirely convinced of the writing style either. I think if you’re going to write a book about a woman hiding the love she has for another for as long as Evelyn did, then there should be a lot of emotion involved, I actually found Evelyn to be quite unemotional. This did change towards the end when a big twist happens (I’m not going to spoil it), but for me it was too late. 

The story itself was a great story. It portrays the struggle that people from the LBGTQIA+ community have faced, especially at the time Evelyn’s career was at its peak. That said I do feel it could of been composed better. I wasn’t a huge fan of the interview style either, the only other TJR book I’ve read was Daisy Jones which was a similar style too. Maybe this is just the authors style but it just didn’t work for me. 

I’m sad I didn’t love this one because I really wanted to, perhaps the Hollywood lifestyle just isn’t my bag. Give me the rugged Cornish coasts, sandy toes and beach swept hair over fame, Hollywood and money any day.

From her place in the store, Klara, an Artificial Friend with outstanding observational qualities, watches carefully the behaviour of those who come in to browse, and of those who pass in the street outside. She remains hopeful a customer will soon choose her, but when the possibility emerges that her circumstances may change for ever, Klara is warned not to invest too much in the promises of humans.

In Klara and The Sun, Kazuo Ishiguro looks at our rapidly changing world through the eyes of an unforgettable narrator to explore a fundamental question: what does it mean to love?

Unpopular opinion ahead --> I didn't get this book. After the raving reviews and all the hype created around it I was expecting a moving, deep story and page after page I kept hoping. But, for me, it just wasn't there. 

The plot was basic and tedious. The narrator robotic and naïve... and I get it, the character is a robot child so maybe it was to be expected but I didn't find any depth to it, I just found it boring and 'simple'. Everyone kept describing Klara as highly observant and clever but she didn't actually do anything to support these claims. Nothing much happened and when something did, it was over explained making me lose interest. 

In the end, I just kept reading hoping in some mind blowing ending, which sadly wasn't there. Did I miss the point? Was I in the wrong mood? Maybe, but all I can say is that this wasn't the book for me. 

Did you read this book? What did you think about it?

17889995864788244;"One of the most common thoughts for people who have already made money (any amount) in their business?

--> No one is ever going to reach out to work with me again.

It's wild to me how common this thought is.
I've thought it... a LOT.

And every time I see someone having this thought - they always have a new client come along after.

The doubt and fear is REAL when we are growing our businesses.

It's normal.
But what it tells us just isn't true.

17952352262351980;"¡Hola! ✨

Hoy os traigo la reseña de ‘Un reino de carne y fuego’. 

Autora: jennifer_l_armentrout
Editorial: puck.ed 
Páginas: 793
Orden de lectura: Segundo libro

Empezaré diciendo que este va a ser un unpopular opinion tremendo porque solo veo buenas críticas hacia este libro y a mí me ha decepcionado mucho. 

No me matéis jajajaja allá voy: 

Para empezar, la trama de este libro es plana y casi todo transcurre en un mismo lugar, esto no sería un problema si sabes hacerlo entretenido (para mí un libro bueno que lo hace es Misery de Stephen King). Como para mí carece de acción, no tengo mucho que contar… en casi 800 páginas de verdad que he sentido que no pasaba nada; aunque admito que en las 100 últimas se ve más la acción y la cosa se pone interesante, ojalá hubiese sido antes. 

Tampoco me ha gustado el exceso de conversación que tiene, estaba alucinando al leer 4 páginas seguidas de conversaciones hablando de lo mismo todo el rato... 

Por otro lado, Poppy me ha parecido cansina, su personaje se ha basado en darle vueltas a las 3 mismas cosas todo el libro. Además, toda la fuerza que me parecía que tenía en el primer libro en este se ha esfumado hasta casi el final. Hawke lo único que sabía hacer en este libro han sido cosas sexuales, no ha aportado mucho más. En De sangre y cenizas me gustaban un montón y en serio os digo que me han parecido dos personajes completamente diferentes. En cuanto a los secundarios, Kieran me ha gustado, los demás me han sido indiferentes.

Además, en el primer libro veíamos más elementos fantásticos y era más épico, este no. Sólo se ciñe a una relación amorosa y poco más, esto hace que se centre en el género romántico y erótico alejándose mucho de la fantasía.

En conclusión, si este libro llega a ser más corto y con más fantasía seguro que habría sido mejor. Me siento frustrada porque cuando terminé el primer libro pensé que la saga prometía bastante, pero ahora mismo dudo que la siga. 

4/10 ♥️

📚I Have Some Questions For You • Rebecca Makkai

The only good thing I can say about this book is that I love Julia Whelan as a audiobook narrator. I went into this with such high hopes and I was bored. So, so bored. This book is all over the place. Tons of characters between the past and present. An unlikable, whiny MC in Bodie. Too many social issues trying to be tackled here; me too, racism, the criminal justice system, corrupt police, child grooming, classism, cancel culture...just to name a few. It would have benefited from scaling back. Also there are portions between chapters where the MC is describing random cases of violence against women which did nothing but detract from the overall story. The ending pissed me off and left me wondering what the point of it all was.

This is my second book by TJR and while The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo left me reeling, One True Loves left me feeling lackluster at best.

It’s hard to put my finger on exactly what I didn’t like, but I will say that while I’m happy with her final choice, it all wrapped up a little too perfectly. For someone who reads and loves romance, I should be happy with a happily ever after but I just didn’t walk away feeling satisfied.

★★☆☆☆ (2,25/5) • 𝙾𝚃𝚁𝙾 𝙻𝙸𝙱𝚁𝙾 𝚂𝙾𝙱𝚁𝙴𝚅𝙰𝙻𝙾𝚁𝙰𝙳𝙾 𝙳𝙴 𝙴𝚂𝚃𝙰 𝙰𝚄𝚃𝙾𝚁𝙰

Y ya empieza a escamarme, porque como comprobaréis en la sexta foto, me he leído más de seis libros de esta autora y ninguno me ha reventado el cerebro.

Si bien es cierto «El Archivo» y «La Ciudad de los Fantasmas» me gustaron bastante, pero ya os puedo contar la temática: fantasmas. Exactamente la misma que la de 'Gallant'.

Y no pasa nada que una autora narre historias sobre un mismo tema (me parece estupendo), pero cuando todo es medio repetitivo la cosa empieza a ser un poco insostenible.

El gran problema de Gallant es que intenta ser una novela, pero en verdad es una historia corta que no presenta ningún tipo de intriga, ni tampoco nos da una trama que realmente merezca la pena leer. Durante todo el relato crees que sí, pero cuando llegas al final llegas a la conclusión de que has perdido el tiempo.

Y es una pena porque creo que esta autora tiene ideas maravillosas, pero con unas ejecuciones un tanto cuestionables. Evidentemente, cada libro tendrá sus afiliados y sus detractores y, para desgracia de muchos, me ha tocado ser de los segundos.

¿Creo que es un mal libro? Creo que es una historia que engaña al lector y te hace creer que es mejor de lo que realmente es. Y en eso tengo que felicitar a Victoria porque el estilo de su pluma es lo que engancha al lector.

No diré que tenía esperanzas con este libro y fuera a redimirme tras el batacazo que me di con la invisible de Addie, porque lo cierto es que ya sospechaba que no era tan bueno como lo pintaban, pero me ha dolido un poco porque la idea base me parecía muy genial. Y es una pena que se haya quedado en saco roto, con una protagonista con la que debería haber empatizado y solo me ha puesto de los nervios.

No tengo claro si seguiré dándole oportunidades a esta autora, supongo que sí, porque soy de la escuela de los que si no saben de algo no pueden hablar de ello. Así que, espero que Victoria sea capaz de enamorarme con lo siguiente que escriba. 

Pero si no es así, tampoco pasa nada, no todos los autores pueden enamorarte.";2023-03-16 17:27:41+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:07.761677+00:00;49;305;es
18077699251316454;"I have been in the UTAU community as a ""hidden"" member since 2017 or so, and this happened to me as well and I took too much time to realize what I should be focusing on. Let me explain myself. Many UTAU begginers create their UTAUs expecting them to become the next big thing in a short period of time. While it can happen, it's very unlikely, and people often quit beacuse their UTAU not getting attention. There are so many UTAUs nowadays that it's difficult to get a spot in the ""known"" part. I'm pretty sure I never made it there, but my friend did following my steps and I'm proud of them. I thought many times on quitting the community. But this is not a contest on who is the famous. It's a hobby. It's a fun thing to do. My two UTAUs remaining are unknown for most people, but I'm happy with them, and I like developing them. Don't get focused in how famous your UTAU is, just focus on having fun!~

Unpopular opinion, please don’t hate me.

I knew going into this book the premise would be very similar to Love and Other Words as everyone had mentioned but I wasn’t expecting it to be exactly alike just with different character names.  I was a little hesitant reading this one as I wasn’t a huge fan of Love and Other, but I will say that I did enjoy this one just a little bit more. I enjoyed the book up to the big reveal of their breakup.  I was baffled and I was really hoping that it wasn’t going where I thought it was going. But it did and I was done b/c I was immensely disappointed with who the reveal involved. Then it was brushed off with just a couple of sentences and fixed.  The build up was so dramatic and long, I was thinking it would be addressed in more depth.  Overall, it wasn’t a book that I particularly enjoyed due to the reveal but I will say it was very well written and a nostalgic story of young love. For this reason, I am giving it 3.5 stars
 
Please take my review with a grain of salt as there are soo many great reviews on this one and you may really enjoy this summer/beach read.";2022-08-29 15:15:45+00:00;2023-03-27 14:41:34.532387+00:00;65;980;en
18200133001240705;"I like the cover.
⠀
There was nothing else I liked about this book. I am not here for stupid girls, with douche-bag guys, toxic relationships, friends and family who don’t acknowledge an obvious eating disorder for years, and a therapist that doesn’t address that but does prescribe Prozac for depression. Then the magic pill works and the stupid girl is well, no more mention of the years of starving herself, but still stupid. There is also a major rift between mother and daughter that isn’t addressed for almost 10 years.
⠀
This book is dangerous. It shows how the main character got skinny and other than a constant hunger and fuzzy brain, she has no other health issues for years!! It glorifies an underage crush on an adult male. It doesn’t exactly glamorize another very toxic relationship, but it is written in a way that the author seemed to want us to be sympathetic to it.
⠀
Just NO.
⠀
So obviously, I didn’t like this book that many have really enjoyed. It has a 3.53 on Goodreads. Others must have seen something in it that I missed and I am glad they read a better book.  It is popular enough that it was made into a series on Hulu. I won’t watch it.

I can’t recommend this book. I honestly can’t believe I read it all, I was screaming at the characters throughout. I read it and read it all because one of my daughters wanted to know my opinion. I am so thankful she didn’t have this same college experience.

QOTD: Do you stop reading books that aren’t for you or do you press through, waiting for redemption?

17984489338946124;"Quando pensiamo all'idea di successo, al sentirci di successo, il primo impulso che la società vorrebbe trasmetterci è quello di inseguire il denaro, la carriera, lo status e tutto ciò che troppo spesso ci viene insegnato essere l'obiettivo da raggiungere. Ma cos'è - veramente - il successo?

A volte non ci fermiamo a pensare alla risposta, inseguendo un piano che la società sembra aver preparato per noi con estrema cura e che ci viene ripetuto incessantemente in ogni fase della nostra vita, assecondando ed alimentando i tanti, troppi stereotipi - anche e soprattutto di genere - a cui siamo abituatə.

Ma come fare ad evitare di inseguire un successo ed una presunta felicità che non sono realmente le nostre? Come fare a non rischiare di passare la vita a salire delle scale disegnate per un'altra persona?

Il successo è estremamente personale, dipende dagli obiettivi che ciascunə di noi decide di porsi e può cambiare innumerevoli volte nel corso della vita. L'idea di successo che possiamo avere a 20 anni non necessariamente coinciderà con quella che avremo a 40 e non c'è nulla di male in questo, anzi. E soprattutto l'idea di successo non può dipendere unicamente da stereotipi di nessun tipo: sociali, economici, di genere.

Moltissime persone potrebbero trovare il loro ideale di successo in cose a cui oggi la società non riconosce il giusto valore, potrebbero trovarlo nell'uscire dai ruoli sociali stereotipati in cui si sentono costrettə. La limitazione del concetto di successo impoverisce la nostra società privandola della sua ricchezza fondamentale: la diversità.

17998306729686252;"Your body needs to feel safe to properly heal. 

What does your body need to feel safe? 

Resources. 

What are resources to your body? 

Energy. 

Where does your body get energy food? 

If you’ve been in a perpetual cycle of dieting, restricting foods or carbs, and fasting for weight weight loss, your body does not feel safe to let it’s most precious resource go. 

Sometimes - through a lot of mindset work - we need to give our body the chance to feel safe. 

We do this by eating more consistently, regulating our blood sugar, and maybe gaining some weight. 

I know that can sound scary to you right now but it’s beautiful what happens on the other side of this. 

Take it from a few of my current patients: 

“I never thought I would say this but I’m eating more, have the most energy I’ve ever had, and my clothes are fitting better and I’m not even worried about how much I weigh.” 

“I have more energy than ever before by eating more throughout the day.” 

“I have noticed I gained some weight, but I actually feel better than I did. My energy is through the roof.” 

I hope this post gives you permission to feel safe enough to gain some weight to heal safely.

3.5⭐️

I find prosopagnosia fascinating and picked up this book after reading a review by fictionalyme.  And surprisingly; we had slightly different opinions! 

I liked the premise of the book and it had potential. The brain absolutely fascinates me and I love to read fiction and on fiction on the possibilities. 

I just never found myself connecting with then main character, or most of the characters. And it felt like the continual “series of events” and misfortune and unlikelihood of it all just was a bit too much for me. It felt too unrealistic in a book that seemed written to be as if this could happen to you.

It was a forgettable read for me.

17965718552166338;"What are some popular book series that you don’t like? 

For me, one is the Atlas Six series. I thought the first book had a lot of potential. The idea surrounding the library of Alexandria and the magic system seemed pretty original and intriguing to me. Also it had a fast pacing with lots of plot twists. However, I felt like because of the pacing, there wasn’t time for character development which is why most of the characters felt flat to me. In addition to that, I just didn’t like most of them. 

In that respect, the second one was much better. The author took the time to make the characters feel more three dimensional. However, that made the pacing really strange and just made the whole book feel like a bit of a mess. 

I don’t think I’ll continue with the series because although I see the potential and kind of understand why the series is so popular, I just feel like the next one would probably disappoint me as well.

So der ernste Teil ist vorbei.

Wie in meiner Rezi zu #harderthanlove angekündigt,  müssen wir uns mal über Erotika/Smut Bücher unterhalten. 
Warum geht man da immer die gesamte Thesaurus Liste durch um Körperteile zu beschreiben? Auslöser der Frage bei mir war ein ""Bleirohr"" in einem Fantasy Erotica Buch bei KU 😅
Und warum immer so groß,  dass ihre Finger sich nicht mal ansatzweise berühren etc. 
Mal ehrlich, wenn er damit nicht umgehen kann, ist doch auch egal 😅

Und dann immer dieser Fokus darauf, wie groß und männlich er ist... doppelt so breit, muss seitwärts durch die Tür....
Tja, und sie jungfräulich. Ist ja klar. Gestern erst wieder ein solches Buch gelesen. Ging gut los, ein bisschen Mulan nur das sie gefangen genommen wird und dann Enemies to Lovers. Alles schick, bis die beiden in der Kiste landen und sie natürlich von nix ne Ahnung hatte und komplett unberührt ist...

Ich hab da so 2 Reaktionen, ""Pack das Trinkspiel aus, es wird lustig"" und nehme es mit Humor oder ""werf dad Buch an die Wand"" wie kann man nur. 

Wie steht ihr dazu? 
Und die Frage die ich mir immer stelle: warum muss das immer so geschrieben sein?

So, rant over. Valentinstag mäßig genug? 😉

17983968055571433;"LESSONS IN CHEMISTRY REVIEW 🔬

Author: Bonnie Garmus
Genre: Historical Fiction
Reading type: Audio
Stars: 🌟🌟🌟💫 3.5/5

Don’t hate me everyone, but I think I have a pretty unpopular opinion on this one 🫣

LESSONS IN CHEMISTRY published April 5th, and I feel like I was seeing it everywhere. And everyone was loving it! I chose it as a Book of the Month pick a month or two ago, and ended up listening to the audio (which was fantastic, by the way). 

It took me a while to put together my thoughts on this. The book started off so strong for me - I was becoming invested in the characters, especially Elizabeth of course. I enjoyed the beginning and genuinely had no idea where the story was going to go. 

The middle of the book was very “meh” for me. I found myself having a hard time paying attention to the audio and I thought it was boring. 

Howeverrrr the last 30% or so I loved once again! There was heartbreak, loss but so much love throughout this entire novel. And Six-thirty was definitely one of my favorite characters (IYKYK). 

All in all, I’d still recommend this book for sure! I’d be interested to see what my rating would be if I read the physical book versus listening to the audio.

17896385684772875;"Oh, hello lovely. ☺️

Recently I read an article on the perils of perfectionism and it got me thinking about my own journey with mental illness and creative constipation.

I fervently believe that we’re all exceptional, remarkable, one-time events in the universe.

But I also believe that getting overly wrapped up in our uniqueness is more trap than triumph.

Perfectionism, as the article I read informed me, is not, in itself, a diagnosable disorder. But is a tenant across many mental health conditions.

It can stop people in their tracks and make them spin out into oblivion. It can be a dream stealer and the ultimate justification for not doing something that’s important.

But as I have learned through my own journey, we can help push through the mental gymnastics and creative constipation when we remove ourselves from the center.

To paraphrase a conversation between Dash and Elastagirl, characters from The Incredibles, ‘if everyone is special, then nobody is.’

And that’s the libration that comes from being “ordinary.”

Ordinary in our uniqueness. Because it’s true, everyone is special and that doesn’t take away from anyone else’s special-ness. If anything it removes the shackles of perfection and allows us to feel free to just be.

Creativity, is by its very nature, both a unique expression and a single iterations of the same thing across time. And it’s not valuable to rank and judge them, as much as it’s important to appreciate them.

As much as we creatives seek to put something meaningful out into the world, to have our worth validated, it’s far more important to discover the kind of freedom that comes with knowing your own worth does not come before or after anyone else’s. 

If everyone is special, then nobody is, and that is what I call true freedom. 💫

17843391299937305;"🌊Book Review🌊

Something in the Water by Catherine Steadman

I loved The Family Game by this author last year. So I was excited to read more. This unfortunately was a miss for me. 

Erin and Mark are honeymooning and discover a bag in the water. This opens a can of worms that they cannot seem to close. 

I could not connect with the MC. She was not very smart and overlooked so many suspicious signs. I wish I would’ve been able to connect with her and found her more believable. There was also a lot of loose threads that are introduced, but don’t seem to play much importance in the overall story. 

One thing I really liked was that the author narrates the audiobook. She has a very soothing voice that kept me listening. Another thing was good and bad was phone calls were made to sound like real phone calls which I thought was pretty cool. But that made them hard for me to hear and understand. 

⭐️⭐️⭐️/5

If you found a bag with contents that were most definitely illegally obtained, would you keep it or turn it in?

this book could have been avoided if the MCs had a five minute conversation, ho boy 😒

sadly, for me, this book fell into the good ol mis-marketed scheme … 🥴 it was super marketed as a thriller or a mystery, even including a set of matches and spooky postcard with my gifted package from the publisher!! however, this is DEFINITELY a literary fiction study of marriage with little to no mystery at all 🥴🥴🥴

I think if I went into this book with the right mind set, I definitely would have appreciated it more. 

MC liv is going crazy after finding a flirty text from her husband’s co-worker on his phone, and she will stop at nothing to prove or disprove that he’s cheating on her. unfortunately, that takes … literally the entire book. 

this book is a perfect example of the miscommunication trope between spouses! if liv took the time to sit down with arno and express her doubts and fears, none of this would have happened and liv could have saved her mental health 😅

is this one on your radar?

17905586033732919;"UNPOPULAR OPINION 
You do not have to spend all your time with your kids, to make you a great mom. 
That’s right! I used to think, if I wasn’t spending every waking moment with them, I was a bad mom. Part of that, was that I literally had to take them EVERYWHERE with me, due to not having babysitters or any help with them. 
If I left to get a pedicure, or lunch with friends, or even when I would go GROCERY SHOPPING alone, I felt guilty! Is that crazy or what? 
I’ve gotten so much better over the last 2-3 years of taking more time for MYSELF, and realizing, I’m a better mom and wife, BECAUSE of the time I take to fill my own cup. 
Hear me mamas, especially you newbies. You do not have to be with your kids every waking moment. It’s ok to NOT want to always be with them. I challenge you to take some time this week. Even just to go shopping alone, go to lunch with a friend, or even coffee (baby steps) and then tell me how much better and happier you are when you’re with your kids. 
YOU ARE A GREAR MOM!
Tell me, do you agree? And if so, do you live by it? Do you take time to fill your cup? 
Do you disagree? Tell me why. 

Ps. I need to get back to this spa, like very soon.

17972936372000655;"Book Review: “The Villa” by Rachel Hawkins. This book has me wanting to go to Italy on the next available flight!⁣
⁣
You’ve probably been seeing this everywhere on Bookstagram. I know I have been anticipating this for a while, as I’m definitely a fan of Hawkins’ books.⁣
⁣
Emily has been having a tough time lately. Her marriage has fallen apart, her health has been shaky, and she’s way overdue on delivering her 10th cozy mystery. And then there’s her childhood best friend Chess, who is creating an empire out of her self-help books, and is even pals with Oprah.⁣
⁣
Chess suggests Emily join her on a six-week stint in Italy. She’s rented a famous villa in Orvieto which was the scene of a notorious murder of an up-and-coming musician. The night of the murder and the events surrounding it inspired both a famous horror novel written by the victim’s girlfriend, and a quintessential 1970s album written by her stepsister.⁣
⁣
The beautiful setting does inspire Emily but it also magnifies some of the difficulties in her relationship with Chess. And as Emily becomes more obsessed with the murder and figuring out what truly happened, she realizes that there are secrets and mysteries in her own life that need solving—and they could be dangerous.⁣
⁣
This really never caught my interest completely. It’s not a thriller or even a mystery, but more of a drama, and while one twist actually was a bit surprising, another I predicted within the first few pages.⁣
⁣
Many others have loved this, so maybe it’s just me.⁣

17945442632530988;"One of the books I binged on our Tennessee vacation was Georgie, All Along by Kate Clayborn. I had high expectations for this one because of all the rave reviews I’ve seen on here, but I wasn’t blown away. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I found it…okay. Like ‘3.5 stars but feel guilty so rounded it to 4, but really wish GR had 1/2 stars’ okay.

Georgie is back in her hometown after the Hollywood star she was a PA for abruptly retires. While helping her very pregnant friend clean out some old things, Georgie finds her high school friend fic, and realizes she didn’t accomplish many of those scenarios she wrote about. So she decides to do them now!

On top of that, Levi (the brother of her old crush) is supposed to also be crashing at her parents house, and he happens to be hot. So now we have a forced proximity, opposites attract scenario at hand, too. Oh, and that high school crush? He’s around and Georgie actually starts helping out at the family resort. But him and Levi aren’t speaking due to some family drama, so that gets thrown in the mix too.

I like Georgie’s growth throughout the book. She doesn’t like (or even know) where her life is now, and spends some time trying to find out what she wants and where she wants to be. There are a couple 🔥🔥 steamy scenes, so that’s definitely a plus. I just didn’t get sucked into the story like I expected. There are a lot of pieces between the friend fic, Bel, Levi, Evan (the old crush), working at the resort, etc and I almost think it’s too much.

Anyway, there are tons of 5⭐️ reviews on GR for this one, so it’s probably just a case of me expecting too much! I did enjoy it, just not as much as I thought I would.

Vorrei poter dire: 125 anni e non sentirli. 

Con 𝐺𝑖𝑟𝑜 𝑑𝑖 𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑒 per me non è stato così, purtroppo l'età si sente tutta e anche lo stile narrativo l'ho trovato un po' troppo datato per i miei gusti e poco scorrevole, anzi per nulla scorrevole. 

Ovvio! - direte: è un libro del 1898 ! 
Vero !!!  Ma 𝐹𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑖𝑛 che fu pubblicato nel 1818 l'ho trovato completamente diverso. 

Ho capito di non aver un gran bel rapporto con i gotici. Dopo la delusione di 𝐴𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑚𝑜 𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑟𝑒 𝑣𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑡𝑜 𝑛𝑒𝑙 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑜, mi si è ripresentato l'ennesimo fallimento, sempre con lo stesso genere letterario... 
Ma non riesco a capacitarmene,  in quanto adoro le ambientazioni cupe e tenebrose.
O forse, non è nemmeno un problema dei gotici, 𝐹𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑖𝑛 infatti l'ho apprezzato molto.

La noia, a dir la verità, è strettamente correlata allo stile narrativo.

17947952315361777;"✨ Book Review ✨

Rating: 2/5 🌟

Book Synopsis: 📚

Bradley Graeme is the star football player, an exceptional student, and pretty much perfect! He’s able to keep his OCD in check and can come out on top of almost any situation, except for when it involves Celine Bangura. His ex-best friend. Celine is obsessed with conspiracy theories and is fine with being unpopular. However, she’s not fine with how Brad abandoned her for his new friends. Now, they’re enemies. When they both sign up for a survival course in the woods, could this be the start to a new relationship? 

My thoughts: 💭

I’ve heard such good things about Talia Hibbert’s books, I couldn’t help but want to try out this one! The cover is cute and I appreciate the representation of black characters portrayed by black authors. I appreciated the author included a list of British colloquialisms in the book's front. It was nice to flip back if needed. This book had a lot of opportunity, but it fell a little flat. The characters may be in High School, but the conversations seemed way too immature. Also, the character development was lacking, especially for Celine. There was a lot to unpack for both characters, and it just did not happen until about 60% of the way through the book. The pacing of the story almost made it a struggle to get through, too. While I appreciate there was some representation of a character with OCD, I wish the author would have explored that more. Overall, this book unfortunately didn’t work for me.

Thank you netgalley and randomhousekids for the ARC.

.

¡Hola hola! 💕 ¿Qué tal? ¿Cómo estáis? Espero que bien 🤗
Hoy os traigo una de las reseñas que tenía atrasadas y es que voy a ir subiendo poco a poco las reseñas de los libros que he leído hasta el momento, así que espero que os guste 😋
El libro del que os voy a hablar es «Los siete maridos de Evelyn Hugo» de tjenkinsreid y titania.ed 
Empiezo diciendo que creo que mi opinión es un poco #unpopularopinion en relación a lo que me dijeron o lo que pude leer en otras reseñas 🫣
Tengo que confesar que me esperaba mucho más de este libro, y es que aunque la historia comienza con un halo de misterio que parece que promete, para mí fueron bastantes previsibles los giros de trama o plot twist que hubo, que no quita lo conmovedor de la historia pero sí el hecho de que no ayuda a sorprenderte 😔
Los personajes, sin embargo, me encantaron 🥰 Evelyn Hugo es una de las protagonistas más completas y complejas que he leído, con más luces y sombras y que la autora consigue que odies y ames casi al mismo tiempo 🌝🌚
Conseguí empatizar mucho con ella y eso es gracias también a la fabulosa ambientación que se nos muestra, ese escenario de Hollywood de los años 50 que tantas historias ha dado para contar 🎥💫
Una de las cosas positivas que tengo que remarcar es la variedad de temas que trata y que tan bien hilados están. Como ya sabéis no voy a hacer spoiler de nada y mucho menos del final pero solo os adelanto que preparéis un paquete de pañuelos porque yo creo que los vais a necesitar 🫢🤭
¡Y eso es todo por hoy! Ya sabéis que me encanta que me dejéis vuestra opinión en los comentarios, si lo habéis leído o lo queréis leer, si os llama la atención… ¡siempre os leo! Muchas gracias a todos ❤️🥰

I am appalled by the sheer stupidity of this entire exercise. 
Granted , the song and it’s picturisation isn’t a cinematic wonder , but the outrage is ridiculous! 
First the clothes, what is one to wear at a beach resort if not swimsuits? 🙄
Second , saffron is a colour , period . It isn’t a religion in itself.
Third, the moves , pandering to the male gaze . Well , there is a whole lot of sexism , disparity , gender exploitation on a daily basis thanks to the male gaze in every walk of life that goes unprotested and unpunished. Point being that the choreography of this song isn’t inspiring/encouraging men to pounce on women/girls as is being insinuated by the video . 
The moral police is twisting itself into knots 🪢 over a song which anyway is going to be forgotten in some time .

18210235192225290;"The Secret History by Donna Tartt 

I’ve said it before and will say again that my bookstagram account is first and foremost my reading journal—an account of all the books I read. I don’t share every single middle-grade book I read with Jonah—for those I only share the winners with y’all here, but for my own personal reading, I try to record everything here. So, not every book on my feed is an endorsement. 

Such is the case with this book. 😂

What I loved:
📓The university setting—love a great college story! 
📓 The discussion of academia in general. This book is absurdly pretentious in so many ways, but I ate all of that up—loved all the discussion of classic history and texts.
📓 The twisty turns and the build-up to the exposition of the big thing that Tartt describes at the beginning of the book. I did really enjoy the first portion of the novel and Tartt’s writing. 

What I didn’t love:
📓 How did I feel about the characters in this novel? To quote the Grinch: “Hate, hate, hate. Double hate. LOATHE ENTIRELY.” Every single one of them. They all managed to be the absolute worst at the same time. I spent the last half of the book wanting to see them receive justice for their awfulness.
📓 The length of the book. I love a great long read, but I was just so sick of these debauched, jerk kids that I just wanted to finish it and be done with it, yet it just kept going and going. 

So there you go. I know many, many of you loved this one, so be gentle with me in the comments. However, it was not my favorite. I set this book on my living room shelves for a book photo, but I promise you that it will not remain in this place of honor next to my beloved copy of Kitchens of the Great Midwest and A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.🤣

Thoughts:

Oh where to start...I was really excited for Lightlark. I preordered it as soon as I could. I was totally pulled in by the TikTok marketing. However, this book really did not live up to my expectations. 

This review does contain spoilers, so be warned!

Also my review is way too long to fit in this caption, so head to my goodreads to read my full review. 

-Lightlark felt very fan-fiction-y, which is totally fine...if it was fan-fiction. Unfortunately, this book isn't 🙊

-The magic systems in this book didn't make complete sense to me. I was often lost. 

-I read other reviews that commented on the use of ""yolky"" to describe the sun in the beginning of the book, and I'll admit I was thrown off by that too. But...it's clearly foreshadowing... However, it didn't work for me. I didn't really get why Lightlark's heart was an egg? That didn't really fit in with the rest of the book.

-The plot-twist at the end didn't make a whole bunch of sense. I didn't think it was set up well.

-The love triangle between Isla, Grim, and Oro came out of NO WHERE!

-Speaking of love interests...Celeste would've been a better one. 

-The romance scenes between Isla and Grim were uncalled for in a YA romance. A lot of reviews are saying that the book isn't ""spicy"" enough, but I think the scene between the too of them was actually too much for a YA novel. I have the B&N edition and there's an extra scene at the end of the book between the two as well. That scene was also too much for a YA book, in my opinion. 

-The writing wasn't great. I found parts of the book to be repetitive.

Long story short, I don’t think I’ll be picking up the next book.";2022-09-12 12:05:39+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:11.729913+00:00;16;0;en

Love in the Time of Serial Killers by Alicia Thompson

I had mixed feelings about this book. I had expectations that were not met, and that’s most likely on me. But I thought there would be more serial killers 😂

The romance was really cute. Phoebe has some issues that prevent her from being able to fully trust her new neighbor Sam. A lot of this has to do with her dissertation subject being true crime. She distrusts people at best and downright suspects them of something nefarious at worst. I wish this had been explored more because I think it would’ve made it more entertaining. 

She’s also a very complex character with complex emotions. I appreciated this, but there were times I wanted to knock some sense into her. By far the best part for me was her relationship with her brother. They didn’t grow up in the best environment and were basically separated by their parents when they were children, but they grow to love each other as adults. 

So I think for a straightforward romance book, this was a good one. But again I just think I had expectations that weren’t realized. I still recommend reading it, but it was a miss for me. I buddy read with graceoliviareads and we had similar thoughts. 

⭐️⭐️⭐️/5

𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗲: Out Now!
𝗣𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗲𝗿: Ballantine Books

Happy Monday! I’m subbing 7th grade today and it’s my least favorite of them all. For some reason I don’t mesh with this group 😔. I cannot figure it out! It will be a long day haha. 

Shockingly 😆 I have an unpopular opinion on this one. Seems to be MO lately. 

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗶𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁:
Novelist Harriet Reed finds herself engaged to Edward Holbeck, an heir of a very powerful family. It doesn't take her long to realize this family is...strange. When Edwards father hands Harriet a tape explaining it is a book he is working on and would love her opinion, she is happy to feel as though she is a part of something.  However, once listening to the tape, she realizes this is a confession, of a murder, and the game begins.

𝗠𝘆 𝘂𝗻𝗽𝗼𝗽𝘂𝗹𝗮𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀:
This had so much potential. I am all about some fun family games and traditions. This was so far-fetched for me I could not relate to any of it. And holy crap, was it slow.  S L O W... I would have ran home and tore into that tape immediately. But not Harriet, nope. Days, and even when she understood what was going on, she still took her time listening to the rest of it. 

The family games were games out of nightmares. The whole thing was just way to odd for me. Honestly, I got 80% in and begged my buddies who read it to tell me the end and put me out of my misery. 

And I moved on....

Take this whole review with a grain of salt because clearly not many felt as I did.

Thank you to Netgalley and Random House Ballantine for my E-ARC of this in exchange for my honest review.

17990377681744530;"Finalmente anche io (insieme a veronica_catucci ) ho letto questo tanto chiacchierato e osannato romanzo!

Premessa : Non dico che non mi sia piaciuto, ma non capisco la valanga di lettori che lo hanno definito un capolavoro...

Per carità è molto scorrevole e il suo compito di intrattenere lo svolge bene, ma tutta la parte interessante della trama si esaurisce nella prima metà del libro mentre dopo fino al termine diventa piuttosto ripetitivo...

La svolta finale risveglia un po' l'attenzione, ma ritengo un peccato che la storia, nonostante i tanti spunti che ci proponeva all'inizio, sia andata a fossilizzarsi su un unico argomento.

Nel complesso è un romanzo molto gradevole, la scrittura è fluida e a tratti durante la lettura sembra di guardare un film più che leggere un libro.

Evelyn è una diva dall'inizio alla fine, un'icona della Hollywood di una volta che un po' tutti rimpiangono. È stata una piacevole compagnia e ve lo consiglio se cercate una lettura diversa dal solito e amate lo scintillante, spietato e pieno di eccessi mondo delle star!";2023-02-02 23:35:48+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:11.737660+00:00;55;473;it

J’ai un retard monstre dans mes chroniques littéraires, et je vous fais l’affront de revenir avec un retour sur ma lecture de « Normal People » de Sally Rooney, qui semble aller à contre-courant de l’avis général.
Tout le monde encense ce roman, et pourtant, je pense m’être rarement ennuyée à ce point, et je dois bien avouer que je ne comprends pas le fort engouement que suscite ce livre ... 👀
J’attendais beaucoup de cette lecture, sûrement parce que j’avais vu passer certaines critiques très positives à son sujet, provenant de quelques personnes dont j’aime habituellement beaucoup les recommandations littéraires, et puis finalement, quelle déception ...
—
Je l’ai lu en décembre dernier, et j’ai mis un temps fou pour venir par ici vous partager mon avis (en partie parce que je n’aimais pas cette photo), si bien que je ne pourrais pas détailler autant ma chronique que je l’aurais souhaité, car pour une fois, je n’avais même pas pris la peine d’écrire quelques notes au sujet de ma lecture, comme je le fais habituellement.
Tout ce que je retiens de cette lecture, c’est un ennui profond et une envie permanente d’abandonner Marianne et Connell, les deux principaux protagonistes de l’histoire, à leur relation amoureuse laborieuse.
Je n’ai rien aimé de ce roman, ni la relation qui lie les deux personnages, ni l’absence de mise en forme de dialogue, ou bien le rythme des échanges entre les deux personnages principaux, entrecoupés de plusieurs mois à chaque chapitre.
—
J’ai tentée de regarder la série, adaptée du roman, et ce n’est pas mieux, malheureusement.
Je suis clairement passée à côté de ce « best seller ». 
Et vous, vous l’avez lu ?
C’est quoi LE roman que tout le monde encense, sauf vous ?

🎮Zevin's writing was so unique and creative, the character development was laid out so nicely and the emotional aspect was a pleasant surprise.The video game talk was very prominent.

🎮This is a book of friendship, love, loss and sadness.It is more a story of how friendship grows and changes from childhood to adulthood.

🎮You definitely need to have a love for video games to be able to enjoy this book. The 90's game nostalgia is on point. I liked learning about the making of video games.

🎮You get to know Sam and Sadie very well as they grow older and they get to experiment life sometimes together and sometimes apart.

🎮The first half was great and I couldn't stop reading! But I started getting a little bored and annoyed

🎮There were so many slow parts, it felt like a snoozefest at times.The writing was a bit pretentious. I think the book could've been cut by at least 150 pages, because I did enjoy the story at its core. I also really enjoyed how the book is written from multiple POVs

🎮I definitely wouldn't let this put anyone else off because so many people have loved it. It just wasn't one for me!

I’m an educated woman. I could easily understand the thinly veiled metaphors in this book. I absolutely hated that the author felt it necessary to explain every little thing to her reader. Just ZERO trust in my intellectual capacities.

Also, the characters felt like one-dimensional allegories to me, and the plot was utterly lacking in nuance. Minimal fantasy and magic was frustrating — why bother recreating a “magical” Victorian England if nothing is different?

Whatever you write, it's gonna be cliché. Accept it and choose which one you want to use. Scientifically this is how everybody's brain function you can't go against it. Stop demonizing the cliché, use them smart and aware instead.

I also feel like a lot of people want to become a profesional writer, which is great. But some people like me who want to write for fun feel out of place and like we should be aiming higher, even if that's not what we want. I may make a post about this if you're interested.

17969145887234363;"I read Daisy Jones & The Six and I… am not sure I liked it 😫 I SWEAR it’s not a format issue for me, one of my favorite books is Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlestop Cafe and that’s full of interspersed news article type excerpts that hint at deeper issues, but maybe that variety is what I needed for Daisy Jones vs only interview the whole time. 

I find myself almost unable to give it a star rating because it feels like one of those situations where I’m wishing too much for a different book and maybe not at fault of the author. There were parts and quotes I loved but overall not convinced on the like. Maybe I’d give it a 3.7?

I made this post in efforts to blab into the abyss about it, no one even needs to read it I just really needed a moment to process after finishing this one 😂 I also attached a GR review that really resonated with me, GR usernames are weird so I did my best to tag the writer! Hopefully I got it right.

17977150649103515;"Go As a River by Shelley Read is a debut novel following the life of Victoria, a woman living on a peach farm in Colorado 1950s.

Of the many 5 star reviews this has so far received , I am a bit of an outlier because unfortunately this book didn't land for me. My biggest issue was that the writing style had hardly any dialogue and had a focus on the setting. This is only a problem because of my preference for plenty of dialogue and minimal descriptions of the setting.

This story is told in the first person and for me, this didn't work as I found Victoria to be quite dull. There were some one dimensional characters that I think couldve come alive if we'd been given the opportunity to inhabit their perspectives specifically Wilson and Ruby-Alice. Both of these characters exist on the fringes of society and yet they have very little agency in this story which is a shame, because they were the most interesting to me. 

The inner life of Victoria felt lacking to me, and so her character didn't feel all that real or fleshed out. Often the events of the story are so front of mind for Victoria that space wasn't given for much of her reflections. There is a particular passage where Victoria tells us she is thinking about specific events, but she never actually says what she thinks, which was a missed opportunity. 

My reading experience with this was not great overall, and because I was frequently bored, I had more time be critical of elements of the book. Having said that, my favourite part was towards the end in a series of letters, which I found very engaging, I just wish this element was introduced earlier and played a bigger role in the book as the middle was very stagnant.

I think if you enjoy books that have a strong focus on setting, and appreciate themes of motherhood, isolation and the natural world this would 100% be your cup of tea, but it wasn't mine.

Note: big CWs for racism including lynching and ableism

17956009474899517;"¡Hola lectores! Hoy os traigo una unpopular opinion😅 ""El priorato del Naranjo"" es un libro que hace años cogí con muchas ganas pero que sin embargo no disfruté.

Me creé muchas expectativas con este libro ya que había visto que a muchos les había encantado. Además con esa preciosidad de portada que me tiene enamorada no dudé en comprarlo. Pero desgraciadamente no llegué a conectar con la historia ni con los personajes, se me hizo cuesta arriba. La cantidad de datos fue para mí abrumadora además de que no terminaba de engancharme, tenía la sensación de que no sucedía nada.

De hecho al terminar el libro seguía teniendo la sensación de que no existía una trama con desenlace alguno, varias cosas quedaron en el aire.

Puede que no lo leyera en el momento adecuado ya que parece un libro en el que tienes que prestar mucha atención y en esa ocasión estaba un poco saturada con el trabajo.

Es una pena porque me hubiese gustado disfrutarlo tanto como otros pero bueno no quita que siga siendo una edición preciosa.

Title: It Starts With Us
Author: Colleen Hoover 
Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️

✨QOTD: What was a book that Bookstagram/BookTok “made” you read?! (Was it ever at my insistence 😂😉)

🔊Song Pairing: Runnin’ Home To You - Grant Gustin

💭What I thought would happen:

Well I proved that old saying right…if my friends jumped off a cliff/bridge, would you? Well obviously. FOMO got me hard with this one. 

📖What actually happens: 

If you haven’t read It Ends With Us do not continue because potential spoilers? But I mean Bookstagram/BookTok has long given away the contents of that read. 

I won’t bother with a summary because most have read it or plan to read it soon and y’all know what’s going on. 😅

🗯Thoughts: 

I need to start by expressing I did NOT have the boner for It Ends With Us the way the majority of Bookstagram does…however, I loved and respected the author’s note. This book felt like the equivalent of hand holding - the fans longed for a happy ending with a pretty bow on top and it was definitely given. I personally think it was unnecessary.

I love endings that feel raw, real and perhaps provide an ounce of hope. Often times domestic violence does not end with a fairy tale ending. That is reality. I like how IEWU at least left it open ended. Closure is not always a part of life. Use a little imagination. Instead ISWU is the longest epilogue ever written. 

Ryle is a garbage human who I’d have rather died than share a child with. I would never ever leave him alone with Emerson. Maybe I lack empathy but my momma instinct would tear him into pieces. I hated how everyone tip-toed around his temper not to cause drama. I understand he cannot be reasoned with but put the dumpster fire in his damn place or he will just continue with his shitty behaviour. Better yet grab a shovel and have an alibi. 

If one of my brother’s wives/partners told me they hurt them in any capacity I would ruin them (my brothers not their partners) Ryle’s sister’s almost casual attitude was beyond a disappointment. I couldn’t care less if there was a blood relation. Women should protect other women.";2022-10-29 13:29:50+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:13.382271+00:00;65;1147;en
17991010744712967;"✨Love on the Brain, de Ali Hazelwood, edición en inglés de Sphere✨

📚 Una nueva comedia romántica situada en la #NASA en la que una neurocientífica llamada Bee se ve obligada a trabajar en un proyecto junto a su archienemigo, el ingeniero Levi, que parece odiarla por inexplicables razones desde los tiempos de la universidad.

💫 En esta ocasión, la mía va a ser una #unpopularopinion. No sé lo que esperaba de este libro pero desde luego, no esperaba que fuera la misma historia de #TheLoveHypothesis. Me explico. 

No soy una gran fan de la romántica, pero de vez en cuando me animo con alguna. A veces sale bien, por ejemplo, con la primera novela de esta autora: me pareció que era entretenida, con personajes divertidos y con química y con una relación bastante sana. Suficiente. No le pedí más que pasar un rato entretenido con un género que no suelo leer. ¿Qué falló con esta entonces? Que es más de lo mismo. Es decir, todo aquello que me pareció original la primera vez me ha parecido repetitivo en esta novela. Los personajes principales son calcos de los anteriores, con personalidades y dinámicas muy muy similares. Ambas suceden en un entorno científico #stem . Incluso el malo parece el mismo. Y por último, reivindica el papel de las mujeres en la ciencia, añadiendo en este caso datos biográficos de #MarieCurie. Así que tuve la sensación de estar leyendo la misma historia, aunque el conflicto sea diferente y en esta salgan gatos 🐱.

En resumen, creo que aunque sea entretenida y la fórmula funcione, la autora debería ir pensando en escribir algo diferente.

⏩ ¿Qué otro autor o autora os parece que repite la misma historia una y otra vez?

17986762144925294;"L'inspiration ✨

Non, je plaisante : la vérité, c'est que je ne crois absolument pas à l'inspiration. Eh oui ! Comme le syndrome de la page blanche...
Tout ça participe au mythe du génie écrivain, qui noircit des pages et des pages en une nuit après des mois sans pouvoir coucher le moindre mot, mais pour moi, écrire demande de la constance, de la détermination et énormément de travail. Non, je n'attends pas que ""l'inspiration"" vienne. Je m'astreins à une routine d'écriture, et j'écris, point. Je me mets devant l'ordinateur et j'aligne les mots. Il n'y a pas besoin d'inspiration pour écrire... 
Si vous êtes bloqué, regarder votre ""page blanche"" indéfiniment ne vous apportera pas un éclair de génie. Il faut comprendre ce qui bloque : un noeud d'intrigue, un personnage qui ne réagit pas correctement. On trouve le problème, on le résout et... on écrit !

Je sais que c'est une unpopular opinion parmi les primo-auteurs, moins parmi les auteurs installés, tout simplement parce que si on désire vivre de l'écriture, on ne peut pas simplement attendre l'éclair de génie !

Quant à l'inspiration avant l'écriture, elle est partout ! Un fait divers, une réflexion d'une copine, un truc vu à la télé, etc. Tout nourrit notre imagination.

Et vous, vous croyez à l'inspiration ?

18333041290030586;"BOOK REVIEW
 
THE PRISONER by B.A. Paris
 
Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Genre: Thriller
 
🚨UNPOPULAR OPINION ALERT🚨
 
Let me begin by saying that I am a huge fan of B.A. Paris.  With that said, I did not love this one.  
 
Things were rolling along in the first part of the book, and I was invested.  The short chapters of past and present timelines kept things flowing nicely, but in the end could not redeem the story for this reader.  
 
Here’s why I say this: 
 
The plot was very incohesive, full of holes, and frankly required suspension of belief to an excessive degree.  To a point, it was simply not believable. 
 
The character development was tenuous at best with a main character that was impossibly naïve. I found it difficult to care about any of them.  
 
The second half was extremely slow, and I found myself skimming a good part of it.  The last chapter infuriated me to the point that I wanted to throw the book across the room.  The ending was as abrupt as slamming into a brick wall.  I closed the book feeling very unsettled to say the least.  
 
While B.A. Paris has written some phenomenal psychological thrillers, this one was definitely not for me.  With that said, I will be eagerly awaiting her next title because I do tend to enjoy her work on the whole.  
 
Available now.
 
My thanks to stmartinspress and netgalley for the opportunity to read this book before its publication date.

🗽Book Review 👩‍❤️‍👨
The American Roommate Experiment by Elena Armas

Rosie quits her job and becomes a writer. After the success of her first romance novel, she is not inspired to write anything special. When Rosie's apartment has an issue, she decides to crash at her best friend's place while she is on honeymoon. She is shocked to see Lucas, her friend's cousin living in the apartment and they decide to stay under the same roof till Rosie's apartment is fixed. Lucas is a retired surfer from Spain and is figuring out what he wants to do with life. While he is a tourist in New York he also provides the needed inspiration for Rosie. 

I enjoyed reading The Spanish Love Deception and felt that it was too long. The sequel to the book didn't strike the cord as much as I would have liked. I felt like there were a lot of missed opportunities with a tourist in NY. Rosie and Lucas didn't connect with me and felt that the book dragged in pacing. Overall, it was a decent romance with some cute moments.

17870851949858892;"Unpopular Opinion: Daisy Jones & the Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid just isn’t worth the hype. 

For those of you who haven’t heard about it and the new TV adaptation: Daisy Jones & the Six is a fictionalized book about a rock band in the 70's in the middle of the era of sex, drugs and Rock and Roll, loosely based on the band Fleetwood Mac. 

I tried. I must have picked it up to stop reading again a dozen times over the last two years. I tried so hard to like this book.

To me the story, written as an interview transcript, made any emotions expressed by band members seem detached and dull. I kept imagining washed up rock stars sitting in a sterile conference room reminiscing about the good ol’ magical days when music was their life. 

After about a year of trying and failing I had seen a few reviews glowing with praise about the author, so much so that I picked up a second book from Reid to give her another chance. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was engaging, funny and each chapter left me wanting to read more. Discover more. And when I got there, through the mystery and intrigue of her past, I felt rewarded. I had a completely different and enjoyable experience reading Seven Husbands, and reading that made me want to try to finish Daisy. 

When I was finally able to get through all 333 pages of it, I felt a massive letdown. Was that really the long anticipated plot twist? I suffered through all of the narcissistic, self-entitled characters droning on and on about Daisy Jones and Billy Dunne’s conflicts for an ending that just fell flat. 

At least I got through it just in time to watch the just-released Amazon Prime series, and I will say I have enjoyed what I have seen of the show much more. The characters are still whiny, but at least the actors do a good job bringing them to life. 

In my humble opinion, skip Daisy Jones and read one of Reid’s other books, especially The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. And, if you’re interested in Daisy’s story, maybe give the TV series a try. At least it’s not worse.

😈 #ThrillerThursday… but sadly a dud from the same author who wrote the spooky and powerful The Sun Down Motel 😓

The Book of Cold Cases has St. James's distinct style, but was an underwhelming read full of unaddressed plot holes and unlikeable characters. The story felt bogged down with descriptions that were more dull and sluggish than creepy and atmospheric.

Still, I loved the gradual revelation of how everyone is connected. I also enjoyed the book's exploration of gender inequality, especially in the 70s. Clearly not much has changed in the past few decades when it comes to women being vilified in the media 🤷🏻‍♀️

I almost felt like… did I get the authors outline to this story and not the full novel? For starters, can a book this short be considered a novel? There was *no* depth. In some ways, I admired the skimming over unimportant spans of time/conversations, and there were wonderfully hilarious one-liners that had just impeccable comedic delivery. But this book had SO MUCH potential. And… idk. It just didn’t deliver. For being *such* a book club favorite… sigh. 

If you’ve read it, what did you think? Sound off below ⬇️ 

Also, anyone have a recommendation for a book like Austenland but that actually delivers this beautiful story in a satisfying way? Would love recommendations.

I’m so behind on my reviews these days, so I figured I’d go back and do some mini reviews to try to catch up somewhat. 🤷‍♀️

The Prisoner by B.A. Paris

I got a lovely finished copy of this one a while back and I think I binge read it shortly thereafter. 
I do that…Oooh shiny. ✨

It’s very bingeable! I really liked the first half and couldn’t wait to see how it ended. 

The second half (and ending) here just got so convoluted for me. It’s hard to put into words. It was just  A LOT to explain the conclusion and what was going on. I mean it was pages and pages of one character literally explaining to the MC why what happened happened. Does that make sense? Yeah, it didn’t to me either. 😂😑

I did enjoy it, but wish the ending were different maybe? Or at least explained differently to the reader. 😉

Not my favorite by this author but still worth the read in my opinion. 

I do appreciate the tagged publisher for my copy and will continue to read her books. It could be just me. 🤣 It usually is. 

Have you read this one?
Wanna validate me? 😏
If not, that’s cool. 🤭

Have a great pre Friday! 
I’m off tomorrow so that’s pretty exciting. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

“All children are victims of their parents’ childhoods, because all adults try to give their kids what they themselves enjoyed or lacked.”

The beautiful writing was Backman’s only saving grace in this book. But even with beautiful writing, the words still have to lead to something, a purpose. I saw no purpose to this book whatsoever. I feel like Backman has piggy backed off the success that Beartown was, but he had no new ideas. We were just treading water.

There were still a few quotes that stopped me for a moment but they were not enough to change my opinion of the book. 670 pages long and Backman spent 500 of those pages dangling a carrot in front of his readers. Of what’s to come, the things that have not happened yet, that will happen soon. 

To say I was frustrated with this book is an understatement. I probably would have DNF’d it if I hadn’t of been buddy reading it with everyones_mad_he.re thankfully, we helped each other through it.

This one didn’t work out but I’ve a few good ones lined up for March which I’m excited for. What are you most looking forward to reading this month?

18256953745147563;"📚Alex, una tossicodipendente scappata di casa e sopravvissuta a un molteplice omicidio, riesce ad entrare all'università di Yale grazie ad un dono: può vedere i fantasmi ed entrare in contatto con loro. 
L'incarico che le viene affidato una volta a New Hale è quello di monitorare le attività occulte delle società segrete presenti a Yale: le famose ""otto tombe"", i luoghi dove si riuniscono i ricchi e i potenti che, infrangendo tutte le regole della magia, resuscitano i morti. 
Mentre Alex si occupa di questo, nel campus muore una ragazza, Tara, e il suo mentore, Darlingthon, scompare. Toccherà quindi ad Alex risolvere questi ed altri misteri che gravitano attorno a una delle università più prestigiose al mondo. 

‼️Unpopular opinion: a me questo libro non ha fatto impazzire, anzi, forse non mi è piaciuto per niente. 
Le premesse erano ottime: Yale, un mistero da risolvere, attività occulte... ho iniziato la lettura con aspettative tanto, forte troppo, alte, alimentate da tutto l'hype racchiuso attorno a questo libro e al suo seguito (che, tra l'altro, ho acquistato prima di leggere il primo🫠) e da tutti coloro che lo hanno paragonato a dio di illusioni (libro che io ho trovato decisamente superiore). 🤷🏻‍♀️Probabilmente non ho affrontato la lettura nel momento più adatto; non gli ho dedicato le giuste energie, fatto sta che l'ho trovato estremamente noioso e non sono riuscita ad immergermi per niente nella storia. 
Il personaggio di Alex non mi è piaciuto, così come non mi sono piaciuti gli altri personaggi, che ho trovato, personalmente, poco caratterizzati; non sono riuscita ad empatizzare con nessuno di loro. 
Riconosco che, visto il grande successo che ha avuto, probabilmente il problema sia mio, e non del testo in sè, quindi penso che gli darò un'altra occasione più avanti.

My Summer Darlings by May Cobb

★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆

The book sounded really interesting and it’s a book where I’ve read mixed reviews.  However I land in the not a fan category - it wasn’t for me.  It took me a while to get into it.  The ending was fast paced, I wish the rest of the book was that way too.  It was mostly the adult women, who are friends but also kind of petty with each other, drinking and trying to get with the same man.  Not enough suspense or mystery for me. 

Q: Is Cobb’s other book, The Hunting Wives worth a read?

17858047274881005;"👀 POURQUOI BRIDGET JONES EST PROBLÉMATIQUE 🔥

Bon, il faut que je sois honnête avec vous. Depuis que j'ai regardé les films (et surtout Colin Firth 🫣), je me dis grande fan de la trilogie cinématographique. Du coup, j'ai voulu découvrir les bouquins 📚 Est-ce parce qu'il n'y a pas Colin Firth ? Est-ce parce que c'est écrit et donc j'en prends conscience ? Aucune idée. Mais après avoir lu le début du livre 《 Le journal de Bridget Jones 》, j'en suis venue à cette conclusion : cette saga peut être toxique ⚠️

Attention, cela n'altère en rien mon appréciation de l'humour, de l'histoire et du réconfort que ce genre de romcom peut avoir sur moi. Mais deux points me font penser qu'à notre époque, le livre devrait avoir la notion Trigger Warning :

👉 Les phrases du type ""J'aime me faire harceler par Daniel Cleaver"" : WHAT ? MAIS QUI DIT UNE CHOSE PAREIL, CLEAVER OU PAS ?!?!?!?

👉 Les ""t. b."" à côté de ""800kcal"" dans le décompte journalier alimentaire de Bridget : depuis quand manger l'équivalent d'une salade composée et une pomme sur une journée ENTIÈRE est t.b. ???

Encore plus que la première, la seconde raison pourrait réveiller certains TCA chez les lecteurs ou lectrices. Leur faire comprendre que finalement, c'est peut-être la seule manière de maigrir : ne pas manger. Spoiler alert : c'est faux 🙅‍♀️

Je n'aurais jamais cru avoir une #unpopularopinion sur une série de films que j'avais autant adoré. Et pourtant... 🫠

I get it. I get the adoration of this book. It is a mesmerizing, captivating, emotional book. I loved Sam and Sadie (and Marx and Ant and Simon and and and…) and how unlikable and flawed they could be but they felt so REAL. I won’t be surprised to see this appear on many 2022 Favorites list. 

Depending on how I think about it, I want to give it five stars. It was so beautiful and the concept of love not being romantic or sexual. Your most important relationship doesn’t need to be your “love interest”. Zevin writes masterfully and how the flashbacks were woven in throughout and all the callbacks 🤌🏼

Depending on how I think about it, I want to give it one star. Reading the second half of this book drained me, made me feel physically ill with heartache, and put me in a weird emotional place I didn’t enjoy being in. That is to say, though, that Zevin’s writing was so well done I viscerally felt it. Although, a lot of it came from a narrative choice that I just wasn’t rooting for based on the first half of the book.

Carrie Soto Is Back by Taylor Jenkins Reid 

I liked it, but didn’t love it 🤷🏼‍♀️
As someone who used to play tennis, I thought I would enjoy this one a lot, but it was almost too heavy on the sports aspect (let’s be serious though, only TJR would even be able to convince me to read a book about sports).

On top of the tennis matches making me yawn, the rest of the book was very predictable and kind of anticlimactic. Comparing this one to Evelyn Hugo and even Malibu Rising, it just felt a little empty and I wanted more. 

With all that being said, I don’t think TJR can write a bad book. Her writing style just pulls you in and keeps you entertained. In true TJR fashion, the character references and depth was perfectly done.

First up, there is no shade to anyone who does any of these things.  We all have different priorities, thresholds and personalities so what works for one, won’t always work for another.  Now that’s out of the way let’s talk about three money making/saving things I *DON’T* do because they’re not worth it (to me).

1. S u r v e y s

It’s rare that I see a survey that pays anything to close to what I’d expect to be paid for my time in a job and so I don’t do them often.  My time is valuable and spending 10 minutes answering questions to earn 20p is not the one.

2. P r o d u c t  R e v i e w s

I find this hard as they’re so tempting! Who doesn’t want free stuff? But it’s not free, is it? Do I want to spend time putting multiple reviews on multiple sites and posting to my own social media for a can of hairspray or a tin of spaghetti hoops? No, no I don’t.  The obligation and deadlines to complete the ‘review’ admin just stress me out because that’s who I am.  I still want to be the person who gets a free Shark vacuum though 🤷‍♀️ 

3. C o m p i n g

I don’t mean entering the odd ‘tag a mate’ giveaway, I mean comping as a ‘sport’. Again, there are some major wins out there (beemoneysavvy I’m looking at you with your Maldives trip 👀) but in general I just don’t have the time to spare bearing in mind I’m writing this caption at 1:30am.

And while this may be an unpopular opinion, we agreed, it simply doesn’t exist and is an unrealistic goal for an entrepreneur. 

BUT…

A healthy work life integration and focus on priorities does exist. 

This doesn’t mean you answer emails while playing with your kids. It doesn’t mean cooking dinner and answering text messages. 

It means you have the freedom to structure your priorities, day and work flow in a way that fits with your values and life. 

Much like any other thing though it doesn’t work without boundaries and systems. 

For me it means getting a few hours of work in before my kids get up, taking them to school every day, spending a few hours on zoom calls while they are at school, picking them up from school, and planning my next day after they are in bed. 

My system works for me. I have very clear boundaries I don’t cross and have learned to say no. What’s your work life flow look like?

⚓ Book Review 🎧
Hook, Line, and Sinker by Tessa Bailey

Fox is a fisherman who is known for his bad boy charm and for being a player! He meets Hannah, the younger Bellinger sister who is sweet and nice. Not only is Hannah immune to Fox's charm and she's surprisingly interested in his personality and being friends. Hannah is back in Westport to shoot for her a movie she is working on, Fox and Hannah are in close quarters. Hannah slowly starts chipping away at Fox and makes him believe that he is more than just a Casanova. But will her heart stay intact in the process?

I absolutely loved It Happened One Summer, It was so fresh and unique. I really liked the glimpses we got of Fox and Hannah and I was desperately looking forward to reading this one. For some reason, this story didn't work for me as much as I wanted it to. I found Fox and his obsession with his reputation a little exhausting. His back story for being a player was a bit lame in my opinion. The chemistry between Hannah and Fox felt forced and not organic like Piper and Brendan. I loved the way Fox and Hannah connected through music via text messaging. That was so cute! I liked Hannah coming into her own career-wise and embracing her connect with her dad through music. I really wanted this one to work for me!

17895080987758318;"The Push by Ashley Audrain 

Synopsis 
Blythe and Violet. Mother and daughter. It's a bond like no other. But what if your little angel is a monster? And what if no one sees it but you?

My Thoughts
This was January’s #lilladiesbookclub pick and it was one I went into with high expectations as I am sure many of you know it is a very popular bestseller. Unfortunately it resulted in the hype coming to bite me. . . 

I did find this book gripping at first and I did speed through it. But the further I read on the more disillusioned I got with it. All of the characters actions just didn’t work for me, I was not convinced.

It felt more like a domestic drama than a thriller or mystery which was what I was expecting and it was marketed as. There was no suspense or huge shocks. It was very predictable and it was basically a story about different generations of bad mothers and their impact on each other over the years. 

There are a couple of very dark and upsetting events which were quite hard to read. As a mother myself, they are every parents nightmare. There certainly was no sugar coating how tough motherhood is in many aspects. But it just felt constantly like the author couldn’t decide if this was a psychological study on mothers or a wannabe horror story that just never came to fruition about a devil child. 

It all resulted in one of the most unsatisfying conclusions to a book I have ever read. I threw the book onto the floor at the last sentence! Why had I read the same repetitive actions and thoughts of the mother Blythe in nearly every single chapter for there to be no answer to it all? Why did she spend years worrying her kid was a psychopath but never thought to take her to be assessed? Why did the police not investigate a certain major incident in the story? What was the point in the book? I can deal with ambiguous endings with certain books but not when I have read a story where not a lot happens and then with no payoff at the end. It just got boring. I think it would have been more interesting to have heard from Violet’s point of view on how her mother never liked her from day one. 

Sorry to everyone that loved this, it just wasn’t my thing! 🤣

It’s an unpopular opinion from me on this one. I have loved all of the Backman books I’ve read but this one not so much. 

My biggest problem was with the main character Elsa herself. She is written as a seven year old girl and I can honestly say no seven year old acts the way Elsa does. It’s just not believable even down to her language and her relationship with her Mum. This girl needed to have been about twelve for me to have been on par with the story. I also couldn’t get into the story telling, I found it mediocre and it just wasn’t strong enough to hold my attention. 

The best character Elsa’s Gran, died just under a 1/3 of the way through and I really felt the book took a nose dive around that point.

17897697158665049;"Happy #JaneAwesomeWednesday! 🎉 

Today's Jan(e)uary prompt from nonsense.and.sensibility is Jane Fairfax - a secret favorite (character, villian, edition, etc.) 

A few years ago I attempted a reread of Mansfield Park, before DNF-ing about halfway through (but that's another story 🙃). You know what one of my main thoughts while rereading was? I infinitely preferred the character of Mary Crawford (""bad girl"") to the book's protagonist Fanny Price (""good girl""). 

Don't get me wrong - I admire Fanny, I sympathize with her situation, etc. I'd trust her more with my bank pin or to watch my kids. That said, while reading I just wanted her to losen up already and have some fun. And yes, I know the situation was far more complicated than that and Austen was being very clever in her portrayal of societal norms and practices of the time. But I couldn't help projecting my 2020s self and beliefs onto the story while reading. (If that makes me not as smart or sophisticated of a reader, than I accept that.) 

My conclusion: I would definitely pick Mary Crawford to be my friend IRL. Interesting conversationalist, up on all the latest trends and hot goss. Down to be petty or snarky on occasion. Mary could totally slide into my DMs or come out for a drink with me any time. 

Am I a terrible person? 😄

18273388813188302;"First of all launching the game felt so soulless compared to Mirai 2 and DX, there was no opening movie and it went for the “futuristic approach” like the DIVA series. It sounds fine on paper but then the main menu was poorly designed. The partner functions are pretty much nonexistent, and there is only Miku standing very still, staring in blank space. The button layout was very confusing as they push the rhythm game in a tiny sub menu above the the main UI, with the calendar, news, and clock functions as the main tabs. The rhythm game was the most disappointing (but I’ll give it credit for trying to experiment as the first game on the 3ds). Instead of the groove coaster style gameplay, the melody icons revolve around circle paths with no clear approach circle, instead a weird spinning stylus which makes it difficult to indicate when to click/press (like a clock, I think this game really liked clocks). PVS themselves are great tho. I’m so glad they improved in Mirai 2, props to SEGA.

⭐️⭐️

March really has me off on some “nothing can satisfy me” tomfoolery 😅

This one started off really strong! Adelaide is walking through her home, pouring gasoline, and the mutilated bodies of her parents have been laid out with care in their bedroom. And after setting the place ablaze, she helps lift an extremely heavy and mysterious steamer trunk into a wagon, the key to its large brass lock kept protectively about her neck, and is soon off to catch a ship out of California and up to Seattle, where she’ll buy a claim and then head out by train to settle in a Montana homestead of her very own, a fugitive just looking for some peace and quiet.

Will she find it? Of course not.

In the beginning, I did very much enjoy Adelaide. I was intrigued by this trunk that she’s so protective of, this trunk that she sneaks down into the cargo hold to sing and whisper to. (WHAT’S IN THE BOX??) Very ominous and spooky things are going down, particularly when we meet the Mudge family on the way out to our final destination, and I was here for all of it!

Unfortunately, I eventually realized that the writing is very shallow. By the latter half of the book, I was mostly skimming because that’s all I needed to do, skim along. There are no fine details, or vivid descriptions, or subtle clues that I need to pay attention to. I’ll be told what I need to know, not shown. There are certain lines that get used repetitively in an effort to build that eerie feel, but just get old fast. The plot meanders a great deal and there’s definitely a case of too much going on and no clear goal. And was this horror? … Maybe vaguely. 

Overall though, a disappointment.

18051751747402238;"Book Review:

The Writing Retreat by Julia Bartz
Rating: ⭐️

When I saw this book in BOTM's February selection, I was instantly pulled in by the premise of a spooky estate and a competitive writing contest. 

Things I loved (or at least liked):

The cover! I liked how Bartz built up the tension once the contestants were at the estate... And that's really it.

What I didn't like:

Basically everything else. The characters were boring and so one-dimensional (except maybe Roza). I usually love plot twists, but each twist tried to take this book into a new book (is it horror? erotica? supernatural? locked room mystery?) and it didn't work for me. 

(Spoilers ahead)

Alex, the MC, decides to write a book about a woman, Daphne, who lived -- and mysteriously died in -- the mansion but the author doesn't develop this storyline -- sometimes I felt like we were supposed to believe that the MC had access to Daphne's thoughts and other times it felt like fan fiction. Was Daphne really possessed by a demon or was there another explanation? Sometimes this kind of ambiguity can be fun but this most definitely wasn't.

I'm okay with some over-the-top elements but the author's attempts to bundle together the MC's self-discovery of her sexuality, a demon lover storyline, a dual narrative / book within a book, and characters with unbelievable motivations were too much. Once Alex finds the dungeon, this novel really goes off the rails. We have a case of one character masking her identity to expose Roza as a murderer / book thief, multiple other characters doing Roza's bidding (both sexually and homicidally, literally), another dying-but-not-really (and some horrific frostbite), an anticlimactic frenemy situation, and a really non-cohesive MC.

And finally, I'm no prude but the sex scenes were cringy.

🛄 Book Review ⛷️
Baggage Claim by Juliana Smith

Olive, who has been reluctant to visit family in Aspen, is forced to spend time with her family during the holidays. On her flight she meets the dashing Finn who is a ski instructor in Aspen. In a reverse grumpy sunshine trope, Finn decides to fake date Olive in front of her family when they meet in Aspen. The truth of what happened in the past that turns Olive into a grinch and how Finn chips away at Olive's defences and gets her excited about Christmas forms the premise of the story. 

I really loved the set up of the book and this reverse grumpy sunshine trope was fun to read. Finn was super cute and loved how he handled Olive. This could easily have been a 4.5 stars or even a 5 stars except for the last 25% of the book where the story line just took a nosedive. I just felt the author did not handle the reason for Olive staying away well. It just felt that she was sadly forced to deal with toxic trauma. Finn could have reacted better instead of making it about him towards the end and then doing a flip in his reaction. The last 25% just made me so mad and left such a bad taste especially when I loved the first 75% of the book. Please check the trigger warnings before you read the book.

Thanks to the author for sending me an eARC of the book. Unfortunately, the version I read had 2 missing chapters.

The best part of reading the book was reading and venting with my besties brennas_book_corner bookwithcollins cozypagesss.

Before I Let Go by Kennedy Ryan

First of all, whether you're into romance or not, this writing is 💯
I loved the conversations about mental health and the importance of therapy. Especially how it connects with grief and motherhood. 
Their son was my absolute FAVORITE character. He was simply adorable. 

With that said, I feel like this book was a bit too long. We focused so much on these side relationships knowing they weren't going anywhere, but instead I wish she'd focused a bit more on the backstory of their relationship, so I could better appreciate them as a couple. Second chance romances don't always work for me because without seeing the start of a relationship, I have a hard time getting invested. I thought the author did a great job at giving us little snippets of the past, but ultimately I was left wanting more. (Well, more emotion but less sex) Their choices before the end of the book, left me feeling a bit icky. 

Just because this book didn't impact me the way it did most people, I can objectively say it's a good book--it just maybe wasn't the book for me. I'd still broadly recommend it, as clearly I have a VERY unpopular opinion. Normally i'd end by saying because I love her writing, I want to read more of her books....but it might be a little too heavy of a romance me to continue reading this author. 

Haven't decided on a rating. I want to give it a 4 because I truly can appreciate it at its core, but looking back, my enjoyment level was at a 3. 
So maybe a 3.5? TBD, lol. (Don't unfollow me please🙃)

17891549708715072;"Babel by R.F Kuang

Synopsis 
Oxford, 1836.
The city of dreaming spires.
It is the centre of all knowledge and progress in the world. And at its centre is Babel, the Royal Institute of Translation. The tower from which all the power of the Empire flows. Orphaned in Canton and brought to England by a mysterious guardian, Babel seemed like paradise to Robin Swift.
Until it became a prison… But can a student stand against an empire?

My Thoughts
This is a tough one to review as I have mixed feelings. The hype well and truly bit me with this one! I totally understand why Babel is popular but for me it was lacking something.

It is about the power of language and translation alongside the terrible history of colonialism. I admired how Kuang explored the corrupt past of the British Empire as part fact and part fiction. She blended historical elements and fantasy together by creating a world that used silver as a type of magical power. The British strengthened its imperial ambitions to corrupt and take advantage of developing countries and its people. 

The writing is intelligent and is meticulously researched. It felt like a modern classic and has fantastic dark academia vibes. I loved learning about the history of words, some parts I was really geeking out over. 

It started strong and I was really enjoying it but it slowed down towards the middle and I felt my interest waning. It eventually picked up in the last 200 pages, I just wish it had more excitement prior to them instead of getting dull and repetitive. 

I didn’t take emotionally to any of the characters and when tragedies occurred in their lives I felt detached. I am usually quite an emotional reader and when an upsetting scene happens I usually feel some kind of sadness but I felt nothing. Maybe if it had less of a repetitive nature and academic talk and had more time developing the characters personalities I might have cared more about what was happening. It was just too long and tedious at times for me to hold my interest. 

I by no means hated Babel, it had some great, thought provoking components to it but I didn’t love it either.

Thanks laurapatriciarosereads for reading it with me 🖤

Daisy Darker by Alice Feeney 

You know when a book is going great, the characters are entertaining, there is good character depth, the setting is super creepy & there is lots of suspense and then the ending comes and ruins the whole book for you? 
Yeah, that’s how this books was for me. 

2 ⭐️ 

**Just because this book wasn’t for me, doesn’t mean you won’t love it. Don’t let my opinion stop you from picking this one up.

❓C’è un libro da cui vi aspettavate molto e che invece vi ha deluso?

Io, a malincuore, devo dire proprio Maybe someday della Hoover.
Sarà che avendo letto da poco Confess e avendolo adorato, mi aspettavo anche in questo libro le stesse qualità che mi avevano fatto amare la lettura precedente.

E invece no, no e ancora no.
Di base non mi è proprio piaciuta la trama della storia, il fatto che i tradimenti siano stati talmente “normalizzati” da far sì che la povera ragazza tradita esca di scena per lasciare spazio a quei due poracci che non avevano il coraggio di ammettere a chi di dovere che erano innamorati l’uno dell’altra.

Se vi state chiedendo cosa faccia Sidney durante tutto il libro ve lo dico io: piange. Piange e basta.
A una certa non avevo nemmeno bisogno di leggere le sue reazioni dopo che Ridge scriveva o faceva qualsiasi cosa. Sapevo già che lei stava piangendo.
E che ⚽️🏐🏀🎱🎾

Non avrei altro da aggiungere, se non che non lo rileggerò mai nella vita.

📖: The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo
✍️: Taylor Jenkins Reid
12h 10min
Fiction
⭐️: 3.5/5

“Preternaturally beautiful and a paragon of glamour and daring sexuality”

“We all just want to be teased”

🔀 multiple timelines
👥POV: multiple first person 
🐎 Pace: medium/slow

💭 This story is told from 2 perspectives regarding 2 different timelines. Monique (the present) and Evelyn (the past). 

What I liked: 
- Diverse cast of characters 
- Hollywood royalty feel to it
- References to Little Women 
- Celia 💕 Harry
- LGBTQ+ rep

What I wasn’t a fan of:
- Evelyn is Latina but separates herself as much as possible from being seen as Latina 
- I didn’t feel anything for this book or most of the characters
- Evelyn’s 6th husband. 
- Most of her husbands
- I hated the twist at the end. Felt rushed and then the book ended

Overall, I feel like this book was only ok. While the characters are written with lots of flaws making them “more real” I don’t think I’m really enjoying this style of writing. At least not right now. I know this is an unpopular opinion since lots of people loved this. 

⚠️ domestic violence, alcohol abuse, homophobia

17939048567015927;"💫 RESEÑA 💫

Hola soñadores ❤️

Hace ya unos cuantos años me leí los tres primeros libros de la saga Shatter Me en inglés y recuerdo que me gustaron. Ahora que puck.ed los está reeditando, me apetecía mucho volver a leerlos ya que me acordaba bien poquito de la historia. Pues bueno...esta relectura ha sido bastante agridulce... 

🌹El libro no es muy extenso y la narración de la autora es bastante amena por lo que se lee en un suspiro
🌹El contexto de la trama, la distopía en si, tiene mucho potencial 
🌹El personaje de Warner me sigue intrigando tanto como la primera vez 
🌹Otro personaje que me ha encantado es Kenji

Y aquí se acaban las cosas buenas

🥀Juliett, nuestra protagonista, es uno de los peores personajes que he tenido la desgracia de conocer en la literatura. No puede ser más sosa e insípida. 
🥀Lo mismo puedo decir de Adam, un personaje planísimo, con un total de cero carisma 
🥀Hay una especie de triángulo amoroso (los odio) y mal llevado
🥀La relación amorosa no me ha podido dar más grima. Nada, pero nada de quimica entre ellos. Es que a cual más soso, repelente y tóxico
🥀Instalove descarado. Es que ha sido bestial lo rápido que se enamoran y se dicen te quiero. No sabéis las veces que he puesto los ojos en blanco 
🥀La trama distopica queda en un segundo plano y se centra en una de las relaciones de amor más aburridas de la literatura juvenil

Menos mal que sé lo que viene, que en los siguientes la cosa mejora un poco, si no, abandonaba esta saga sin dudarlo 🤦🏻‍♀️

Le he dado un 2,5/5 y he sido bastante generosa 😅
🌟🌟

¿Tenéis pensado leerlo?

17975085805958763;"FIRST DNF OF 2023

💬 What's the last book you DNFed?

Last year, there were several books I considered DNFing but didn't. Every time, it ended up a meh three-stars at best and a catastrophic one-star at worst. So one of my goals for this year is to DNF more, so I don't waste days (or weeks!) slogging through a book I'm not going to ultimately enjoy.

But I didn't think the first DNF of 2023 would come so quickly, especially since my January TBR is entirely comprised of books that were many people's favorites of 2022. I mean, that's a surefire recipe for success, right? HAH. Wrong. So very, very wrong! Four of the five books on my January TBR were fails, but none more than the most hyped book of 2022, Babel.

Babel just isn't for me. The academia element is far too central for someone who doesn't like academia to begin with, but I might've been able to handle it if the plot was engaging enough. Sadly, 132 pages in, the plot was missing in action. There was what I think was an inciting incident—Robin meeting Griffin—but even after that, it was pages upon pages UPON PAGES of Robin's life at school, and I kept wondering, when is something going to happen? Is anything ever going to happen?!

Then I heard someone say that the middle is indeed quite slow but the end really picks up. THE MIDDLE?! I was still at the beginning! Because yes, dear friends, 132 pages is not even the first quarter of this 545-page beast. I knew then that I couldn't do it. I couldn't trudge through another 400 pages, no matter how many people loved this book—I clearly wasn't going to be one of them.

And so, Babel is my first DNF of 2023. And I'm not only content with that decision, but honestly... relieved. Here's to listening to my heart!

17872755155751508;"What is your most unpopular bookish opinion? 

I recently finished Shadow of the Gods by John Gwynne and have another unpopular opinion for you: I didn’t really enjoy reading this book. 🙈

My experience with it was very strange. I loved the writing style and really felt like John Gwynne had improved a lot since writing Malice. Also, the world building and lore were incredible. Based on those things it would definitely have been a five star read, so I absolutely get why so many people loved it. 

But I just couldn’t get into it because I didn’t really like any of the characters and the plot wasn’t really something I was interested in. 

I feel like this year I’ve been figuring out what I like and don’t like in fantasy. And now I know that I don’t enjoy dark fantasy where the only thing the characters seem to do is fight. I think I only like that when it’s mixed with humor like in Joe Abercrombie’s books. 

So if you like those things I’ve described then this will definitely be a book for you. It just wasn’t for me and I hope you don’t all hate me for it now 🙈😂

17973198620127540;"Beautiful mumma, 

You are bound to feel overwhelmed when you have a high-conflict coparent setting fires 🔥 around you and you’re trying to do ALL the things and have too little time to do it. 

It’s only natural to feel that way.

Feeling overwhelmed is a debilitating feeling, especially when you’re on the cusp of taking radical action right at the edge of your comfort zone ⛔️

It can feel like the scariest thing you’ve ever done in your life…outside of surviving emotional and psychological abuse, to:

🖤 Clear the coparenting drama
🖤 Fully stand in your truth, and 
🖤 Own your place as the emotional safe and influential parent

It makes absolute sense that your ego would use that “safe” feeling of overwhelm to stop you from trying anything 🤦‍♀️

WHY?

Well, we all know that any time you feel overwhelmed, the last thing you want to do is take any kind of action. 

The moment you become aware that your ego is sabotaging you, amazing things can happen, mumma! 🙌

🌈 If you’re ready to step out of self-sabotage so you can wake up every morning without that pit in your stomach about what your coparent is going to say or do next then

I invite you to book a complementary clarity call ☎️ with me where we have a heart-to-heart conversation 💞 to see what’s really possible for you and your life on your journey to becoming Unshakeable.

17926885826566994;"📚 Book thoughts 📚

We all have different bookish opinions, and all thoughts are valid, but have yours ever been so far from everyone else's that you're left feeling straight-up wrong!? If so, what's the book?

Mine is A Far Wilder Magic 🫣. Part of me is convinced I need to reread it and give it another chance. The other part of me is confident that would be a waste of time. 

I have yet to see a negative/middling review of this book. Readers who have extremely similar tastes to my own rave about the setting, characters, and themes. But I just could NOT connect with it. 

1) Wes & Margaret were preparing for a deadly, legendary hunt, and yet it was sooo boring. They each went off and did their own thing, Margaret to the woods with her horse and her hound & Wes to the lab or into town to flirt with other girls, which brings me to...

2) Wes was indifferent to Margaret and Margaret cold to Wes from the beginning, and despite spending hardly any time together, 2/3rds through they are in love? Wes literally calls Margaret homely, and then she is suddenly beautiful. I'm sorry, but what!? If he had gotten to know her, fine, but even though it's just the two of them in a secluded house, they spend all their time apart. 

Margaret & Wes have both constructed effective masks for the world, but my problem is those masks were kept up with the reader. I felt so distanced from their true thoughts even though the story is told in dual third person limited. It wasn't until the last quarter that the masks started to slip. As they came off, it was apparent how Margaret and Wes complemented each other. However, I still didn't believe the romance. 

A big theme of this book is belonging, finding your home, be that a place or a person. I think Wes & Margaret did find that in each other, but the message was dimished by forcing them into a traditional, romantic coupling. You don't have to find romantic love to find a sense of belonging. 

Honestly, there are very few book romances I don't get behind. If an author tells me two people should be together, I'll believe them. But I 💯% think Margaret & Wes should have been best friends. I thought the same about Peeta & Katniss.";2023-03-12 15:04:31+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:19.231526+00:00;9;19;en

17925673253187401;"SERIES REVIEW: Finlay Donovan

✨ vibes - swipe for memes ✨

FINLAY DONOVAN IS KILLING IT - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

it’s a fantasy that everyone thinks about once or twice - if someone offered you an obscene amount of money to get rid of someone, and you desperately needed the money, would you take the money? for finlay, it’s a back and forth argument almost the entire book. 

I can say that while I certainly enjoyed this one, it wasn’t my favorite. the characters were so self absorbed and obnoxious that I seriously wasn’t rooting for any of them. I loved the concept a lot, but I think it fell flat on the execution. 

FINLAY DONOVAN KNOCKS ‘EM DEAD - ⭐️⭐️💫

I, once again, didn’t love this one. I still am annoyed by all of the characters, even more so in this one, and not in a love to hate way. finlay is somehow more idiotic - leaving her phone with a dead body, letting vero handle alllll of the money, impersonating a lawyer, breaking into a prison, stringing on two beautiful men who DESERVE BETTER, and yes getting involved with multiple professional mafia members. 

I appreciated the quick action in this one, but I felt almost let down by the conclusion. it set up the next book nicely but by leaving this one on a cliffhanger, I felt that there was no real resolution to this one. everything just sorta faded away. 

I definitely will plan on reading the next one because they’re fun and easy reads. I just wished I liked literally any of the characters so I could actually root for them 🤪

does anyone in this place agree with my unpopular opinions or am I alone on this island? 🤌🏼

Ich finde Tamlin auch nicht so schrecklich wie alle anderen. Ja, er hat ziemlich scheiße gebaut und Feyra nicht so super behandelt. Aber ich bin mir sehr sehr sicher dass da ein bisschen mehr hinter steckt und er das nicht einfach aus Bosheit getan hat.

• Außerdem finde ich die Bücher von Brittainy C. Cherry komplett drüber 🙈 Ich liebe Drama, wirklich. Einmal schön rotz und Wasser heulen und dann ist Guti!

The wait took a bit, and when my doctor came in, I honestly just wanted to get through my questions fast and not ask about all of the things on my list because I assumed they must be running behind after the wait I had. My doctor could tell I still had questions and was patient with me. Through her listening, I realized that this is how she treats all of her patients. I realized today that if I have to wait longer at my appointment so that the person before me is able to finish their list of questions, then it’s okay. My time is no more important than the patient before me, and I truly want everyone to leave their doctor appt feeling like they were heard instead of rushed. 
Being rude to the office, staff, nurses, doctor etc about my wait wouldn’t help anyone. I thanked everyone I could there and decided that spending an extra hour at the doctor than I anticipated wasn’t that bad after all

Und ich kann direkt mit einem aufwarten.
""The House in the Cerulean Sea"" ⭐️⭐️___🫣
Für mich war es der letzte Versuch, mich diesem Roman zu nähern. Gefühlt jeder, der dieses Buch in die Hand nahm, liebte es. Sein Cover erinnert einerseits an ein Kinderbuch und mich speziell an ""A Series of Unfortunate Events""/Band 3 ""Der Seufzersee"". Es taucht ein großes Gewässer auf mit einem Haus auf der Klippe, Waisen und seltsame Wesen. Aber wenn es dann darum geht, wie schlimm es mit der Bürokratie werden kann, gefällt mir Lemony Snicket um Längen besser. Dagegen ist Klunes Roman was? Cozy-Officialism? 😵‍💫
Um mit Linus dem Protagonisten zu beginnen war mir der von Beginn an unsympathisch. Wir lernen ihn an seinem Arbeitsplatz im Umgang mit seinen Kollegen kennen. Er ist ein feiger Schleimer, der jede Kritik runterschluckt, sich tölpelhaft verhält und sich von jedem beleidigen und rumschubsen lässt. All diese Eigenschaften legt er spontan ab, als er an seinem Auftragsort ankommt. Solche Menschen begegnen mir auch im Alltag. Sie sind der Archetyp eines Diederich-Hesslings aus Heinrich Manns Roman ""Der Untertan"". (Zitat 2. Bild)
Doch ist das der Kritikpunkt hier im Buch?
Nein.
Wird die Gesellschaft kritisiert, die solche Menschen hervorbringt?
Nein.
Wer ist Schuld daran?
Man selbst.
Wird vielleicht kritisiert, dass Linus als Mitarbeiter des dortigen ""Jugendamtes"" Teil des Staates (weil Exekutive) ist und damit dieser Staat an sich?
Absolut nicht.
Man soll als Leser (wahrscheinlich) nur kuschelig eingedieselt werden und sich darüber freuen, dass alles ein gutes Ende nimmt.
Der Drache wurde besiegt.
Die Prinzessin bekommt ihren Prinzen.
Alle leben glücklich bis an ihr selig Ende.
Denkt einfach mal daran, wenn ihr das nächste Mal beim Besuch einer Behörde feststellen müsst, wie toll es ist, auf der falschen Seite des Schreibtischs zu sitzen.

17971386775563171;"UNPOPULAR OPINION 📣

Ogni scrittore ha in serbo una storia autobiografica da raccontare e Veronica Raimo lo fa in questo libro a mio parere senza infamia e senza lode.
Libro breve, ironico, da leggere tutto d’un fiato nel quale mi sono anche ritrovata in realtà: madre ansiosa, padre laconico, un fratello migliore in tutto.

Mi ha tenuto compagnia per qualche ora, ma non mi ha lasciato nulla.
Non è un brutto libro, solo non è il libro per me in questo momento. Non cerco qualcosa che mi tenga compagnia sotto l’ombrellone.
Ho bisogno di libri da sottolineare, di storie con personaggi ben caratterizzati e autori da amare.

Premio Strega? No, non direi.

I hate the taste and I hate the smell. 
Everything about it is gross. 

But like most people, I need a little caffeine to start my day. So every morning you'll find me drinking an iced chai tea latte (always iced, never hot) that my husband made for me. He either leaves it in the fridge for me, or brings it to me in bed if the kids and I are awake before he leaves for work. 🥰

Also, how cute are these ""Mama + Mini"" cups he got us for Christmas?! Swipe to see.

•••
Giving the Christmas vibe a spicy twist this Monday! The holiday sprint has officially begun. I had two family parties over the weekend and got to bake my favorite Christmas cookies. This week is full of more parties and dinners then I'm planning to sleep for a week. 

💬 QOTD: What are you reading / watching this week?

✨ currently reading ✨
Finished Tis the Season for Revenge by Morgan Elizabeth on my flight home last week. Sorry but, #unpopularopinion, it wasn't for me. In short, I really liked some aspects of it but overall I disliked more than I liked. Queue the reminder that reviews are always subjective — if you're looking for a smutty take on Legally Blonde this could definitely be for you! I loved LB but didn't love this spin on it. 

Hoping to get in a couple of novellas this week: 1) Christmas in Quincy by Devney Perry (so excited to start this series))! and 2) Resting Scrooge Face by Meghan Quinn.

✨ currently watching ✨
Watched Something From Tiffany's over the weekend — it was so cute! If you've been missing Kendrick Sampson's hazel eyes since Insecure went off the air, you can get your fill by tuning into this one.

17998646143712304;"STONE COLD FOX 💎💸😏 BOOK REVIEW

✍🏼: Rachel Koller Croft 
🌟: 3.5/5 (3 on goodreads)
📖: debut suspense/thriller 

“The most fun games are the ones you already know you’re going to win.”

Man, you guys…I seriously wanted to love this one 😕. I’ll be honest, I liked this book okay. It was entertaining during some parts, but the majority fell super flat for me. 

The character development alone was pretty shallow & the timeline/story was kind of all over the place. There were a lot of questions I had and significant plot holes, in my opinion. I feel like there needed to be more to Bea’s past included in the story for me to like her & her decisions more. There were just a lot of moving parts that went unaddressed or left to the wayside?? The book felt incomplete and very rushed. (And the CHAPTERS 😫 such long…long chapters lol)

Some things I DID enjoy were the DRAMA 🍿!! These characters were absolutely brutal to each other and I actually cringed at how freaking awkward/embarrassed I would be in some of their situations lol 🫣🫠. I did literally *gasp* 🫢 out loud at a few of the plot twists I wasn’t expecting, but they still didn’t give me that “WTF factor” that I love out of a good thriller/suspense. 

Also, the epilogue left you on a weird cliffhanger that was underwhelming, yet I would definitely search for spoilers if there were to be a sequel lol. 

Overall, this book won’t make my top fav books by any means, but it was entertaining enough! I’d love to see this as a movie or series! 🎥 📺 

If you’ve read this one, what are your thoughts!?

17847885500822208;"📚𝗕𝗼𝗼𝗸 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲...I know this is probably going to be an #unpopularopinion 😬 but I was NOT a fan of House of Sky and Breath. While there were a few things I enjoyed, overall this book was a miss for me. 

𝗠𝘆 𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: ⭐️⭐️/5
𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄: HoSaB was a huge disappointment for me, because I loved the first book! And I’m a huge fan of SJM’s other series, too, but this one just didn’t do it for me. 

For starters, it felt way too long. I’m okay with slow burn plots, but this one was so repetitive that it really just drug on and made me wonder what the true “point” of the book was. 

I did enjoy the characters and their banter, the spicy scenes were 🔥🔥, and the character development was overall pretty good. But unfortunately, it didn’t fix the fact that this book was just so slow and repetitive. I’m super bummed out right now because I had such high hopes for this book. Ugh. 

*SPOILERS BELOW*

The biggest disappointment for me, though, was the plot twist at the ending. I had a feeling it was coming, but now I’m just worried about what’s going to happen with the ACOTAR series. I hope that they don’t get too messed up by this new addition of throwing Bryce into their world. There’s so much going on in that series, too, and honestly I just wish they’d been kept separate. I love the ACOTAR books and just hope that they stay as great as they have been and don’t become drawn out like this book was.

17973690328957625;"The Villa by Rachel Hawkins 

This one is everywhere on insta and so many people loved it... unfortunately I did not! 😆

So here's my unpopular opinion review! 

I struggled with this one. It was so slow and I had no interest in the characters. It was told via two timelines in the present and the past but I felt like nothing was happening (in either timeline) until the very end. There was no suspense and the ending was just ok. 

I did enjoy the setting and there was one twist that I didn’t see coming which was perfect. If you enjoy slow burns and dual time lines you might enjoy it, but this one wasn't for me. 🤷

⭐⭐

Hola! Al fin terminé este libro!!! Me llevó casi un mes. Me pasó lo mismo con el 1ro, no logro engancharme con la historia ni con los personajes... Y eso que le puse ganas porque quería que me gustara.

EL REINO DE LOS MALDITOS: LOS SIETE CÍRCULOS DEL INFIERNO
Kerri Maniscalco. 475 páginas
Fantasía con romance. New Adult. Editorial pucklatam 
⭐️⭐️

💬 RESEÑA: me resultó pesada la narrativa, medio que pasé algunas escenas rápidito para avanzar. Me gusta la idea de fondo, el misterio del asesinato y la creación del mundo, pero no logro enganchar con la historia o que me preocupe el destino de los personajes. Me parece como que estira demasiado las situaciones. Y la ""investigación del misterio"" que es lo que más me llama la atención, siento que no está tan bien logrado. Admito que al final cuando revela algunas cosas, me intrigó y tengo ganas de leer el 3ro. Pero le tenía mucha fe a esta trilogía y no me está encantando... 😭

📚 SINOPSIS: Emilia, para vengar el asesinato de su gemela, se embarca en una misión que la lleva a los siete círculos del infierno para convertirse en la Reina de los Malditos, junto a Wrath, el príncipe de la Ira. Entre pistas contradictorias, palacios, galas y traiciones, Emilia irá descubriendo secretos y que no todos son quién parecen ser.

💫 TROPES: enemies to lovers, hidden identity, forced proximity

⚠️ TW: asesinato, tortura, consumo de alcohol y drogas, sangre, acoso sexual

Me & Zoe having the same tonight. We enjoyed watching the wiggles while we ate.😛
Zoe is sporting a new hair style as she swished her curry soaked fingers through her hair. 

Edit: I won't be judged or penalised for allowing Zoe to watch TV at meal times. This is my choice to do so, im not advocating others to do so, that's your choice and I don't judge you for your decisions. I'm simply showing what meal times is for us. Just because the TV is on does not mean Zoe is ignored, we talk, we sing and be silly. We eat in our livingroom as we don't have a dining room and our kitchen isn't big enough to house a table and chairs. We still sit as a family, just not round a table. And just because we watch TV does not mean it will have a negative affect on her in the future. What I show on my account is just a small proportion of our day.

I really want to like this book, the synopsis sounds promising and the cover is beautiful which is why I decided to give this one a try. Unfortunately, this one is not for me😣

While the world building seems fascinating but it wasn’t explained in detail, I’m still confused by the magic system in this book. 

I didn’t like the writing style and the romance aspect of this one. The conversation feels too formal and stiff which makes it weird. 
The romance happens way too fast and I couldn’t feel the spark between the female MC and the love interest. 

I have a hard time connecting with the characters as well, the only character that intrigue me is the villain. I wonder if he’s pure evil or a morally grey character. Maybe there will be more explanation and also the villain’s POV in the next book to understand him better. 

The last few chapters pique my interest a little bit with what happened. 
This book has the potential to be more and if things got more developed and explored, I think it’ll be a great series.

Book 2 in the Blood and Ash Series
Available now

I really enjoyed From Blood and Ash but it was a true struggle for me to get through this. I think I only kept reading because it was a buddy read with bookishbakingmama theninjanursethatreads and spillthebooktea 

There is so much repetition throughout the book. I am sure it would be half the length it is if we hadn’t had to hear Poppy’s unchanging thoughts on an endless loop, as well as various descriptions. Dimples, right dimple, left dimple, stupid dimples. So violent, Princess. Stab, stabbed, do you want me to stab you? It’s not real, it’s pretend, it’s fake. Spice and pine, lush spice and pine. So curious.  I could go on! I actually started to feel anger every time I read the same words again. Sentences were also repeated just in different ways, here’s an example:

“… may resemble a mortal who is no older than thirteen, but in reality, he is older than you by many years. So is Quentyn”
ON 👏 THE 👏 NEXT 👏 LINE 👏 
“That made sense… Quentyn may look my age or slightly younger, but he was most likely years older than me.” 🤯

Don’t get me started on Poppy’s incessant questions which were a tool regularly used to move the story forward and inform the reader. Honestly, this book felt like it was just thrown together to bridge a gap between book one and three. 

The worst part of all of this is that, as infuriatingly painful as the first 38 chapters were, the last 7 were just interesting enough that I might read book three. 🤦‍♀️

Maybe 🤷‍♀️ Possibly 🤔 Perhaps 😏

The only opinion that could be maybe relevant is the opinion of someone who is mentoring you, someone you look up to and take as a role model.

Although eventually you discover that the only opinion that really matters is the opinion of the 8 year old version of you and the 80 year old version of you: 

The inner child and the inner wise parts of you are the ones that need to approve of your choices and be satisfied with your life.

𝙍𝙚𝙫𝙞𝙚𝙬:
🩸 As thrillers go, this one is run-of-the-mill - unreliable narrator, traumatic past and present danger. 
.
🩸 The premise is good. There’s not much action or gore, so the story is mostly psychological. I was expecting a razor sharp plot, but I found some plot holes. Also, I could predict all the turns, which slightly blunted its edge.
.
🩸 The characters, including the MC, behave inexplicably. I had a lot of questions about why a character would do something the way they did.
.
🩸 The show and tell are at odds with each other. Chloe keeps saying she’s an addict, but she seems stupid rather than drug addled. She keeps saying she has trust issues, but she trusts everyone quite quickly, not being suspicious of weird behaviour until it slaps her in the face. She says she wants the truth, and yet when she’s handed half a clue, she makes no attempt to go back for more info, even when she very easily could.

let me start by saying this was my most anticipated read of the year… i’m so disappointed. i dnf’d it 400 pages in. it made me so sad that i disliked this book so much because twngo is my favorite book of all time!! i tried so hard to like this book but i just didn’t care about the mc’s or the plot. nash was soo annoying and i felt like he was trying to manipulate lina into being with him it was weird and creepy. and lina was super annoying too literally she was obsessed with being alone and then got mad at people when they left her alone like what??? she was a super selfish mc and it just pissed me off. and i thought going into this book i was going to read a romance book with subplots of other things like in book 1 but no. this book was like just trying to find the bad guy from the first book the ENTIRE time. so boring. and this book is so unnecessary to be 600 pages long like so many chapters could be taken out. like i didn’t need to know about lina’s friend from high schools son doing his chores. this book was seriously upsetting i’m so sadddd.

18048571459352107;"Happy Saturday!!!

I didn’t love this book. At all. But man if I didn’t really want to. 

This book is split into two halves. I found the first half to be depressing and long and somewhat boring. I felt bad for the main character. I wondered where this was going and what the point was. Although the writers prowess is irrefutable, I just wasn’t feeling it. But I decided to push on although the prejudice in the book was nauseating.

The second half of the book was more lively. More interesting. And the mystery became readily apparent. However, the ending was in ways, slightly predictable even if it was a great way to end it. The ending may have been the very best part.

Overall, this book didn’t live up to the hype in my eyes. I give the first half a 3.5 and the second half…I’m still trying to decide. Not a 3.5 but not a 4.0? Whatever exists between that. 

Maybe my biggest issue was that I was out of my favored genre. Maybe that was some of the struggle? This isn’t typically my kind of read. I did like the who dunnit portion though. I also loved the vivid descriptions of the marsh. Like I said, the writer is talented. I just didn’t love the story. 

⭐️QOTD: Did you read this book? What did you think? Do you have any opinions that are unpopular on popular books?

17862892997866323;"Título: Cuando el cielo se rompa y caigan las estrellas
Autor: Cherry Chic

LC compartida con mi querida Jenni de amor_porlalectura a la que tengo que darle las gracias por aguantarme, soportarme, y pensar lo mismo que yo en este libro. Porque os digo la verdad, parece que esta comunidad y nosotras no hemos leído el mismo libro. Pero vamos a ponernos en situación.

El padre de Vera ha muerto (POR SI NO TE HABÍAS ENTERADO), y Maia es obligada (por si tampoco te habías enterado) a mudarse al pueblo perdido de la mano de Dios en el que vive su padre en Estados Unidos. Spoiler alert: los abuelos de Maia son dueños de medio pueblo, su padre es el dueño de la única cafetería del pueblo y el tío de Maia es el profesor buenorro del instituto del pueblo. Pero el padre pretendía que nadie supiera de su existencia.

El primer día en el pueblo, van a la casa de su tío Martin, quien les abre la puerta sin camiseta y, cuando van al pueblo, Maia se agobia porque pasa de una ciudad enorme como Madrid, a un pueblo que no te recorres en 10 minutos andando pues porque estamos en Estados Unidos y hay una casa por kilómetro y a eso le llaman “pueblo”. Pues se agobia, y se acerca al embarcadero del pueblo (que se llama Rose Lake… porque es lo único que hay) y se encuentra con el chico atormentado del pueblo, cantautor y buenorro y ocurre el instalove. Y la madre con el tío. 

A ver, suena muy hate, pero coño, casualidades, que las cuatro voces narradas del libro, se enamoren entre ellas y se correspondan y todos con sus traumitas. Porque es un libro de traumitas. Del prólogo hasta el epílogo. Que, además, el prólogo es un capítulo del libro. No me parece… Además, es un libro a 4 voces, que suena a una, porque todos tienen traumitas y solo piensan en lo mismo.

¿Se nota que no me ha gustado? Lo siento, pero ha sido la peor lectura del año.

❓Devo ammettere che ho iniziato questo libro con un grosso pregiudizio: lo stile di Holly Black non mi va a genio ( #unpopularopinion lo so) e non aiuta che l’inizio di questo romanzo sia un po’ lento per i miei gusti. 

🌒Ma capitolo dopo capitolo Charlie Hall mi ha conquistata, con i suoi modi bruschi e il suo essere un personaggio 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 𝘨𝘳𝘦𝘺 che sicuramente non guasta! 

📖Charlie ha un passato da truffatrice e, nonostante sia uscita dal giro, resta invischiata nella ricerca del Liber Noctis, manuale sulle ombre per cui sembra che i criminali siano disposti a uccidere pur di metterci le mani. 

✨Tra segreti che vengono svelati pian piano, il lettore si trova a mettere insieme i pezzi di un puzzle che verrà spiegato solo in chiusura e la Black guadagna punti con un libro che offre tutte le risposte alle tante domande che sorgono durante la lettura!

🃏La storia di Charlie e Posey, le due sorelle cresciute a tarocchi e inganni, mi è piaciuta moltissimo e i salti temporali che troviamo nei capitoli aiutano a farsi un’idea migliore di questi due personaggi. 

👤Sul worldbuilding sono un po’ combattuta: tutto ruota intorno alle ombre che in questo universo sono quasi entità magiche dotate di volontà e sui cui si sviluppano quattro discipline legate al potere dei crepuscolanti, persone in possesso di ombre animate. 

🪡Poteva essere più approfondito, ma il fatto le ombre si possano rubare, tagliare, cucire e alterare mi ha davvero affascinata e mi ha colpita il modo in cui in ogni capitolo si scopre qualcosa di nuovo sul contesto, stimolando l’immaginazione di chi legge senza fornire tutto e subito! 

💡Decisamente promosso (la copertina forse doveva convincermi a prescindere! 😍). Voi avete letto altro della Black?

💭 What’s a book that didn’t live up to the hype for you? Or a book that did live up to the hype if you don’t want to be negative!

🚨 UNPOPULAR OPINION ALERT 🚨 

What I liked:
💋 the side characters
💋 the side plots
💋 overall queer love
💋 high school theater nostalgia
💋 the graduation scene
💋 the audiobook narrator

What I didn’t like:
💋 Chloe (the MC): unbearable, obsessive, and a bad friend
💋 Shara (the LI): manipulative, Margo from Paper Towns wannabe
💋 their relationship was toxic & I couldn’t root for the romance
💋 lack of character growth until after I already found the characters irredeemably insufferable
💋 anticlimactic mystery
💋 almost DNF

Sadly, I’m thinking that Red, White, and Royal Blue may have been a fluke, and otherwise Casey McQuiston books are not for me. I felt similarly about One Last Stop where I loved the side characters and their found family dynamic but did not care too much for the main couple. I really wanted to love this one, but it just wasn’t for me. ⭐️⭐️/5

Dear Diary,

If a book makes you read it at a go, with maybe short breaks, does it end up landing on your favorites shelf?

It literally hurts me to write the review of this book, not because it shattered my soul but because it failed to do that exact job. 

I'm a BIG Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni fan & earlier I've loved 3 of her works (The Palace of Illusions, The Forest of Enchantments & The Last Queen); so obviously I was anticipating her latest release ""Independence"", which is set in pre-independent India & follows the story of 3 sisters—Deepa, Jamini & Priya—as they witness the country emerge into a free India but amidst the celebrations, there's a changing wave of socio-political structure of Bengal & horrors of partition, which will affect the sisters in ways they aren't prepared for. 

I entered the story thinking it'll be a poignant read with Divakaruni's effervescent storytelling, and the partition horrors of the East is something I haven't read extensively, so it did piqued me to see what magic Divakaruni would create,but sadly the charm was swayed after a few pages & I wasn't left enamored enough. 

The extensive research & the effortless shifts in the narrative from the eyes of 3 sisters reflects beautifully, but I felt the story pretty generic & way too dramatic for my taste. 

I did not find myself attached to a single character nor did their tragic moments leave me bawling. Every time I felt the story was progressing forward, it doubled down backwards & kept going around in circles. The characters for split seconds reflected relatability but then again they would become insufferable & I failed to see them mature in their hardships over the pages. 

The love triangle & overdramatic turn of events reminded me of Melodramatic daily soaps & movies. The deaths being used as plot devices to mend broken bonds & in the midst of the sufferings the mistakes one should be held accountable for, being forgotten & forgiven didn't sit well with me.

17944420889477683;"👻 Thriller Thursday 👻
Hidden Pictures by Jason Rekulak 
⭐️⭐️⭐️/5

“‘ I see her every night,’ Teddy says. ‘She sleeps under my bed so I can hear her singing.’”

Mallory Quinn is in recovery from an addiction to opiates, and takes a nanny job for a sweet five year old named Teddy. Mallory is living on the family property in an old tool shed that was converted into a small guest cottage.  She begins to hear noises at night, but her hosts are able to explain them away.  Teddy is a budding artist who draws sweet pictures for Mallory, but then the pictures begin to have dark and creepy elements to them, and share similarities with Teddy’s imaginary friend Anya.  Mallory is determined to find out who Anya is and what Teddy’s drawings really mean.

Okay, Bookstagram, here’s my unpopular opinion about this book.  There were many elements that I liked- an unreliable narrator, the creepy pictures, and fast paced, easy to read writing.  However, I could not get past certain elements of this book.  I don’t know if I’m reading too much into this, but it seemed like there are strong political undertones to this book. I hadn’t seen that mentioned in any reviews here, so that surprised me. I also found it to be pretty transphobic- unable to say much here without giving spoilers, but again, wasn’t expecting that.  On a separate note, I just didn’t care for the supernatural elements of this book. I’m not always a fan of paranormal books unless it’s done well, and I didn’t love it here. So, I honestly would not recommend this book, which disappointed me after seeing so many rave reviews.  I felt like it started off okay and then just went down some strange rabbit holes. I struggled with how to rate it, because I did enjoy parts, but ultimately I just can’t give it a better rating with some of these problematic elements. However, it is a popular book here so I’d still encourage you to give it a read if it interests you!

The Golden Spoon 
⭐️⭐️/5

Genre: Mystery 
Length: 288 pages 

SYNOPSIS 
Marketed as a combination of Knives Out and Bake Off, this cozy mystery follows 6 contestants during the filming of a hit TV baking show. All is well until a body is discovered, and everyone is a suspect 

OVERALL
One of my most anticipated reads that unfortunately fell flat. 

Although I loved the premise and the baking competition aspect was so fun, the execution left much to be desired. A drawn out mystery, strange pacing, unlikable bland characters, and a predictable end made this relatively short read feel miles long. 

Nothing much happens in the first half and it’s just so obvious which characters we shouldn’t like and who may have ulterior motives. 

Unlike the brilliant work that is Knives Out,  there isn’t a thoughtful deduction at the end. The whodunit is explained in the end, but given the rather obvious hints, there isn’t much surprise or work for the reader to do to understand what really happened. And that’s what makes mysteries fun!? Utterly disappointing. 

Thank you naturally.caffeinated.reader and daniallreads for buddy reading this one with me. I’m thankful we were all on the same page about this one so fully from start to finish 😅

This book was 1000% worth the hype and was an easy 5⭐ (one of only three for me so far this year - I'm stingy). Don't let the cover fool you, this book was hard hitting at times, a power anthem to feminism, and was both heartbreaking and hilarious. What really stole the show was Six Thirty the dog. He may be my favorite book character of the year!

Unpopular opinion alert⚠️ I understand why others love this book, but it was just ok for me - I'm learning that this author, while absolutely a great writer, just isn't really a fit for my reading preferences. Henry writes characters with A LOT of emotions and feelings and captures the grief process so well. But oftentimes her books end up reading a bit like a Hallmark movie, which isn't my thing (another unpopular opinion😅). Nora's relationship with her sister Libby was exhausting and the main focus of the book, and I kept waiting for her to realize how unhealthy her lack of boundaries was. If you've loved other books by Emily Henry though (especially Beach Read - this one felt very similar), you'll definitely love this one, too.⁣

17985390604504162;"Book Review of The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood 

Rating: 3.5/5 🐨 

Book Review: 

🐨 The story is set at Stanford University between a third year PhD student Olive Smith and Adam Carlsen, a young professor. Both are in STEM. Olive and Adam start fake dating after Olive kisses Adam because she needs to convince her best friend Anh that she can date Olive’s old crush. 

🐨 The story was an easy read, and flowed well the book itself was overhyped unfortunately. Though it was a good book, it didn’t blow my mind the way I thought it would and this may be an #unpopularopinion I did enjoy reading it but I think because I got caught up in the hype that #booksta gave it, I overestimated the punch the book would bring. I wish I’d read it before everyone found out about it.

🐨 I was thankful the power dynamics between student and teacher were well defined and conversations around consent were handled with care. The #BIPOC folks in #STEM were well represented and the #advocacy for more #women in STEM was too. Loved that!  There was a bit of #spice, which was well-written but overall I don’t think I’d re-read this anytime soon. 

🐨 What I liked:  This book had all the romance tropes!

First of all, it was boring, but I usually LOVE what others think of as boring. This was on another level boring. 
The characters were toxic and so were their relationships/ friendships. 
I disliked the writing. Felt very monotonous and flat. Not original. 
And I also disliked that it included every current “controversial” social issue. It was too much to put in one book. Even though I thought the book was way too long. 

I guess I should start reading more classics, since most of the newer releases fall flat for me lately 🤷‍♀️

👫Mi problema vino ya con los personajes. Ella me pareció una cría que no sabía ni lo que quería, y él un machista prepotente y demasiado celoso. 

🔥No es un secreto que adoro las escenas spicy en los libros, cuanto más alto voltaje, mejor. El problema es que en este libro llegaron a un punto que me parecieron vulgares. No por la escena en concreto, sino por el vocabulario que utilizaban. Consiguieron sacarme de la historia completamente. 

Me dio mucha rabia, por que en serio que tenía muchas expectativas, pero creo que fue una de mis peores lecturas del mes 😢

 Why?

In comparison to ""loyal"" employees who average a 5% pay raise/year. 

We know for people of the global majority, this is the difference maker. Especially for folx who grew up in poverty, financial security becomes even more important. As is being able to support and provide for our family, elders, community members. 

We also know that people of the global majority often experience racism, are subjected to workplace harm, are more likely to be overlooked for promotions, are underpaid, and often pushed out of companies for speaking truth to power. 

Instead of questioning the character and ""loyalty"" of the candidate, question the circumstances and the conditions that led this person to seek employment elsewhere. 

This will tell you more, than the assumptions often made about a “job hopper”. 

There are stories behind every departure. 

Let’s get curious.

✨ R E S E Ñ A ✨

Experiencia horrible, nefasta. Una unpopular opinion más grande que una catedral:

🎤 Al principio me encantó reencontrarme con el típico humor e historia ligera de Beta. Los personajes son muy reales y las situaciones muy entrañables.

🎤 A medida que avanzaba en el primer libro, empezaba a preguntarme dónde estaba el progreso de la trama, ya que hay dos historias en paralelo: el presente y el pasado.

🎤 La historia del pasado se desarrolla en exceso, tanto, que cansa. Por no hablar de la exageración de escenas sexuales, que bueno, es algo que cuando lees a Beta ya sabes con qué te vas a encontrar. Y el presente no avanza porque se centra en contarte lo que ocurre en el pasado.

🎤 En el segundo libro la trama del presente se empieza a desarrollar mucho más. Notamos que avanza y que se centra en desarrollarla.

🎤 Problema: en un momento dado hay un conflicto entre los personajes y la decisión de la protagonista es tan desesperada que le quita el realismo y la originalidad que estaba empezando a tener.

🎤 El final es predecible y no estoy para nada conforme con él.

🎤 Creo que mi disconformidad principal ha sido que no he conseguido conectar con ningún personaje. No entendía las decisiones de la protagonista y el resto de personajes no me llegaron a gustar.

What to do when your friends and family don't support your business.

This can be really painful. And to us it can feel like our friends/family don't care about us or our happiness.
That they don't believe in us and our dreams.

What's wild is that the reality might be the exact opposite. The reason that they seemingly aren't supportive of your business is that they DO care about you, your happiness, and your dreams. They just don't see how this is the path to that the same way that you do.

And that's ok. They don't need to.

You don't need their active support of your business to succeed. And they don't have to be active supporters of your business for them to still be otherwise amazing friends/family members.

Q: give me your most unpopular opinion. 

I haven't posted an unpopular opinion in a while 🤔 this is not my most unpopular but I think it's very unpopular. Soooo let's go!

King of Scars and Rule of Wolves are for me a perfect example of unnecessary books and author just wanting some money. #unpopularopinion

Rule of Wolves was good, like it was a fun read.... but it reads like a fanfiction. And King of Scars is just so fucking bad it hurts lmao. The ending was the cheapest shot I've ever seen. I'd expect it from a new author writing their first book, not someone as big as Bardugo tbh. This duology didn't do it for me. And I gotta admit it made me love and respect her less as an author. I literally sold all her books except for Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom... and well, this one. The only reason I haven't sold is Rule of Wolves because reading it was fun and seeing the Crows made me happy. But I think I'll sell it eventually because looking at KoS just makes me wanna vomit. But then again covers are really pretty and they look good on my shelf. 🤣

I absolutely love the world Bardugo created in the Grishaverse and I'm totally in love with all of the characters... but these books were just a huge disappointment.

Let's hope Bardugo stans aren't as violent as SJM stans lmao

17963311732825610;"Hello ~ back again w another short review to share :-)

I’d seen ‘The Swimmers’ by Julie Otsuka all oher bookstagram and goodreads so i was v excited when I saw my library hold was available!

I liked this one a bit more towards the end!

The writing style for a good chunk of this book was very repetitive and told in lists (ex: ‘She remembers her name. She remembers the name of the president. She remembers the name of the president’s dog. etc.) And it continued this way for entire chapters of this book. The chapters felt sort of disconnected… initially speaking about a community pool then somehow transitioning to a story of life and loss???
The subject of mothers and daughters was visited from such a fragile pov that it feels wrong to not love this but i was annoyed by the writing style and overall this was not for me :( 

The thing is… asian (literary) fiction is usually either a huge hit or a complete miss for me 😶 Often times it’s bc of the translation (in this case the translation was done quite well, but overall not for me) but sometimes I feel like I’m grasping at straw. Here I am thinking there’s more to the plot than there actually is and by the end of the book I’m left wondering if I’m too simple to understand the depth of its contents 🥲 Again, just not for me 😭

‼️unpopular opinion alert‼️

2.5⭐️/5 stars 

This is the last book of this 3 book series and while I feel some amount of closure in how this whole story ended I also just didn’t really enjoy this final book… please don’t come for me with your pitchforks!! 🫣
.
We saw in book 2 that Pip had taken a dark turn and that only got worse in this story as she continued to spiral. Her past actions have clearly begun to weigh on her and that only made her current choices rather questioning. 
.
The beginning was pretty slow and then when *it* happened I’m not sure how you can’t not see it coming. Because of that, there was no big twist or shock factor for me and I really just couldn’t wait for this book to end… I’m SO bummed. 💔
.
Excuse me while I mope for a few days from disappointment over how this series ended and the fact that this is my first low rated book. I need a pint of ice cream & a romcom now. K bye.

Bonnie Garnus
Historical Feminist Fiction

Thank you to Penguin Random House Audio for the complimentary copy!🎧

I picked up this audio purely because it is Barnes & Noble’s book of the year. Yep, you read that right, their top book for 2022.

There were two very strong facets in this book; the POV from the dog and the misogyny. The dog’s point of view was my favorite! He was insightful and smart but also did what he could to help. The fact that Elisabeth had him pick up her child from school says volumes! Next is the misogyny. It was heavy. Very heavy at times. This book is based in America during the 1950’s. Experiencing it “with” Elisabeth made it all the more impactful. Her grit was admirable. She ran by her own set of rules. She knew what was right and stuck to her guns but she did not have an easy time at it. 

My biggest problem with Elizabeth was that she was socially awkward. I thought I’d connect with her on all levels with this but no, she ran with the awkwardness further than I ever have. The humor got lost and it just became…. awkward. Oddly, I still admire her as a character. She had more determination than I will ever have. She called out injustice and then set about to change it. Amazing! She was making waves and impressing upon others to be who they want to be. 

In conclusion, I was not impressed by this one. I loved the message, I loved Elizabeth’s strong will and general non-acceptance of anything negative. But I never grew to love the characters, never felt any emotions one way or the other toward them. The story was slow and dragged multiple times. And while the misogyny was interesting, it did not impact me enough to change my rating.

AUDIO REVIEW: The audio left me underwhelmed. I’m not sure if it was the writing or the narrators. I wanted to feel the frustration and anger she was feeling but the narrator was so even keel that I never quite felt anything.

I was really intrigued about this one and certainly the idea of cannibalism fitted in perfectly for an October read.

Sadly, I couldn’t get into this at all. The biggest stumbling block for me was the period. It was set in the 1800’s. Unfortunately unless you’re Jane Austen I’m just not interested in this period. I also found the writing simplistic and bland. I wanted gore, lots of it and I wanted descriptive writing and unfortunately this book didn’t offer either.

It’s the latest casualty to be added to my DNF pile! 😭

It’s Wednesday and I’m off for two days now. Horray! How is your week going?

Ms. Demeanor by Elinor Lipman

There was a lot going on in this book, especially considering it’s under 300 pages. And there was a lot that didn’t serve any purpose to the story. And storylines were introduced just be left unresolved. I felt like this had so much potential, but it fell short for me. 

Jane Morgan makes a regrettable decision. She recklessly decides to have sex with a younger colleague on the roof of her building. A neighbor from across the street calls the police after spotting them. She loses her job and is placed under house arrest, while the man gets off scot free. 

While I loved the premise of this story, there was too much going on, and it seemed like the book couldn’t decide what story it wanted to tell. So it told all of them. There’s a TikTok cooking channel, romance that felt extremely insta love, a green card marriage, a possible murder, and that’s just scratching the surface. But so many plot lines are not resolved. 

I received a #gifted copy from harperperennial. I’ve been hesitating sharing this because of the ongoing strike of the HarperCollins Union, but it seems they have reached an agreement! You can visit hcpunion to learn more. I’ve also been hesitant about sharing this negative review because it seems to be a #booktok favorite at the moment. So don’t let me discourage you from trying it yourself!

Can you read a book & not really know what you were reading about the whole time? I found this to be jumbled & too many characters were introduced up front. While it was intriguing, it was utterly confusing. I was questioning my sanity bc I was not comprehending what was going on 😅

It was attention grabbing initially, & definitely action packed, however, the situations were extremely unrealistic & there was no distinction between when the past/present memories started. I felt absolutely no connection to any of the characters & found myself not really caring what happened to them 😬 . This also took me waaay too long to finish & it’s bc I found myself not excited to pick it up 😑.

I really wanted more. This is my first book by Alex Finlay, but I do still plan to give his others a shot, as I’ve heard great things about THE NIGHT SHIFT.

18261323848143938;"Elena Armas mini review + review 📚

The Spanish Love Deception — Unpopular opinion here, but I didn’t love this one. I love dual perspectives in my romance novels, and I think I would’ve liked this one more if I got to know Aaron better. He was super sweet and sexy, but I feel like I didn’t know him as well as Catalina. And it just dragged a little too much in the beginning for me.

The American Roommate Experiment — Maybe I should be thankful for what I ask for. We got Lucas’s perspective, but I didn’t love the male narrator during his parts. He was like whispering? Using his bedroom voice? I mean it was fine during the steamy scenes, but it bothered me the rest of the time for some reason. I loved the incorporation of Spanish though!!

But I actually enjoyed this one. Rosie was very relatable for me. Especially when she would zone out and not hear a word of what you were saying to her. And I, too, can be very annoying. It be like that sometimes. I also liked that she quit her job to follow her passion. 

Oh, and there is a dog named Taco.

I only wish that her brother’s story was elaborated on a little bit further, since it was included. Adult entertainment is a legit job so don’t shit on it, but if there was something nefarious going down, I’d like to know!! Maybe this was just a set up for another book, though? 

CW: PTSD, panic attack, nightmares

A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder Series⛓️⚖️🚨
Author: Holly Jackson
Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ (3/5)

A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder (4⭐️)
- I wasn’t expecting to love this book as much as I did! There were so many twists and turns. It’s a YA book, so I wasn’t sure how it would compare to other thrillers I’ve read, but it was so entertaining and I really enjoyed it!

Good Girl, Bad Blood (3⭐️)
- This book wasn’t bad, but I liked the first book more.
- The ending was unexpected, but nothing really led up to it. Everything that happened at the end of the book kind of came out of nowhere and then suddenly it was over.

As Good As Dead (3⭐️)
- It was clear Pippa was struggling with PTSD in this book and her behavior was concerning. She betrayed a lot of her own values and I was genuinely worried about how this book would end.
- Pip used to focus on finding the truth, but that wasn’t the case in this book, so I was disappointed in her.
- I liked the last line in this book and the gravity it held, but I think the book should have gone in a completely different direction than what it did.

Each book was darker than the last, and while the entire series of events was unrealistic, I still liked it! I felt like I was truly along for the ride in this murder mystery series and wanted to keep reading until each case was solved! I was disappointed in the third book, and I wish the series would have ended differently.

I guess I have an unpopular opinion about this series, so I’d still recommend reading it because you may love it!";2023-02-16 12:59:03+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:23.059394+00:00;20;0;en

FOTS started with a bang. Frankie trying to carry out her escape plan to leave her abusive husband with her high as a kite Aunt Daisy.

Then the story tapered off a bit as we go back and forth from Daisys early life in the 1920s to Frankie and Daisys voyage to Los Angeles in the 1960s. They both have big plans when they arrive in LA, especially Daisy with her a 40 year axe to grind.

The story reminded me somewhat of Anywhere You Run - historical fiction mixed with a tad of suspense. It was good but lost my attention a few times.

18018764923512538;"📚Rezension | Als Agatha verschwand 🇬🇧📖🕵🏼

Im Jahr 1926 verschwindet die britische Kriminalschriftstellerin Agatha Christie. Zeitungsaufrufe und eine landesweite Suche bringen zunächst keinen Erfolg. Erst nach elf Tagen wird sie in einem Hotel in Yorkshire erkannt. Zeit ihres Lebens hat die Autorin behauptet, sie könne sich an diese Episode nicht erinnern. Soweit die Fakten. Nina de Gramont hat um dieses geheimnisvolle Verschwinden eine fiktive Geschichte gesponnen und auf diese Geschichte war ich sehr gespannt.

Erzählt wird die Handlung aus der Perspektive von Nan O'Dea, der Geliebten von Agathas Ehemann Archibald Christie, der plant, seine Ehefrau für die jüngere Nan zu verlassen. Das fand ich zunächst einen spannenden und ungewöhnlichen Einfall. Leider konnte der Roman meine Erwartungen aber nicht erfüllen. Zwar ist die Geschichte teilweise ganz interessant konstruiert, in weiten Teilen jedoch für mich unlogisch und voller unmotivierter Handlungen der Charaktere. Neben dem Erzählstrang, der 1926 spielt, werden immer wieder größere Abschnitte aus der Kindheit und Jugend von Nan O'Dea eingeschoben, die für mich einen anderen Duktus hatten, als die eigentliche Haupthandlung. Thematisch war das sehr interessant, was sich im erzkatholischen Irland abgespielt hat, es harmonierte dann aber nicht mit dem Rest. Der Plot hätte ohne Agatha Christie als ""Aufhänger"" besser funktioniert. Die Krimiautorin spielt ohnehin eher eine bessere Nebenrolle. Die Protagonistin ist eindeutig Nan, die allerdings eine unsympathische Rolle einnimmt.

Wer sich nicht vom Klappentext täuschen läßt, der geheimnisvoller klingt, als das Buch ist, kann sich dennoch gut unterhalten fühlen. Der Roman läßt sich gut lesen und spielt zweimal auf das Werk von Agatha Christie an, was mir gut gefallen hat. Leider konnte mich das Buch insgesamt aber nicht fesseln und ich habe recht lange gebraucht, um es zu beenden.

18048820159395383;"I’m the kind of doula that likes to dig deep into root causes of issues that come up in the pregnancy, birth & postpartum phases. I remember when I was a beginner doula & was contacted by one of my beautiful clients. She was having her second baby and wasn’t concerned much about needing me for any other reason besides for the 4th trimester phase when her husband needed to go back to work. She told me her first experience with this was a nightmare. She was extremely overwhelmed and didn’t feel supported or even as connected to her baby as she felt she should have been. After talking with her and her husband I decided to ask her how her first birth went..she proceeded to tell me things about her birth that she didn’t even REALIZE were traumatizing. I had to explain to her that sounded like a very unnecessarily difficult birth and she didn’t deserve that experience. She decided to hire me as her doula for the entire process and we came up with a plan to have the most empowered, natural birth possible. She followed through…waited to go in the hospital until she was in active labor, squatted on the bed and pushed her baby out unmedicated, and smiling through the process. She was shocked and didn’t know her capabilities for birth! She had no tearing and healed beautifully. Total opposite of her first experience. I remember her telling me she didn’t realize she would feel so great after giving birth! She felt she didn’t “need” my postpartum support half as much as she imagined. I was thrilled ♥️ 
.
Your birth space matters, and so does your birth experience. I too, have experienced PPD and PTSD after a traumatizing birth and that is what pushed me to do what I do. The birth experiences I have set myself up for since was and will be sacred, calm, kind, & gentle. The integration period of the postpartum phase is easier to transition through when you aren’t traumatized from your birth experience. No one is talking about the importance of this… but I will because I have seen it time and time again, as well as for my own self. ✨✨ -Doula Lacy

Although this profile is named liftnbookswithme I have yet to post about the first part of that screen name. With that being said, allow me to introduce my favorite hobby outside of reading: lifting weights.

Answer of the Day: I workout and read. Lifting weights is my preferred method of working out. Mind you, I’m by no means a lifting beast over here. 🤣 

Today had a focus on shoulders and the majority of that workout I lifted 5 or 3 pound weights. The program I do requires me to do a lot of reps in a short amount of time so that can really add up quickly.  There’s no shame in my little weight game over here! 

Now to take care of the second part of my mental health and get my read on! 😁💜

18126077986287648;"Dove sei mondo bello, Sally Rooney 🎈

!!ATTENZIONE!! UNPOPULAR OPINION
Lo scrivo subito, a me questo romanzo non è piaciuto 🙈👎🏻
Premetto che è il primo romanzo che leggo dell’autrice, e devo dire che per me è stato una delusione.

La storia, ne abbiamo sentito parlare in lungo e in largo, narra della quotidianità di 4 ragazzi tra i 29 e i 36 anni, che si districano nella vita, nella società odierna, nel mondo pieno di problemi che conosciamo tutti e nel quale tutti viviamo. Fin qui niente di strano.
Mi aspettavo, da ventinovenne quale sono, di ritrovarmi tra queste pagine, o di trovare per lo meno qualche punto di contatto con questi protagonisti.

Non è stato così. La lettura mi ha creato momenti di disagio, incomprensione, mi sono sentita distaccata rispetto alle vite dei personaggi e ai loro modi di fare, di parlare, di scrivere. I protagonisti dialogano e si scrivono tra loro con un linguaggio che non mi è per niente familiare, è stato davvero estraniante.
Inoltre, nonostante capisca la volontà di scrivere un romanzo sulla quotidianità, quindi inevitabilmente tratteggiarne la banalità che spesso la pervade, non ho trovato punti di contatto, niente ha destato il mio interesse. 
La mia espressione era praticamente sempre tra lo sconcertato e l’annoiato.

Purtroppo per me è stata una lettura respingente 🤷🏼‍♀️

So che è piaciuto a moltissimi, ma è giusto parlare anche dell’altra faccia della medaglia!

E voi lo avete letto? Siete dalla parte di chi lo ha adorato, o non vi è piaciuto?⬇️

17954346395151702;"You Must Remember This by Kat Rosenfield 

I was so so excited for this because I absolutely loved No One Will Miss Her last year. It was fantastic and one of the biggest twists I’ve ever read. 

Not only was I so excited because I loved Rosenfield’s previous work, but this was also described as “a knives out-style whodunnit with a twist of Taylor Jenkins Reid”… two things I love? Sold. 

But it wasn’t that to me, and it took me forever to read this book. There are dual timelines which I thought wasn’t necessary, or at least not as often. I understand why they said it was knives out in style, but the mystery wasn’t there for me. I’m also not sure how it has a twist of TJR at all? Which is totally fine! But if I’m thinking that’s what I’m going to get, and it isn’t actually the fact, I’m going to be disappointed. 

I did enjoy the setting of this super eerie house, and some of the relationships- like Delphine and her grandmothers. 

I was so excited for this, but unfortunately it just didn’t work. But here’s the thing you may read the synopsis and think oh this sounds like something I love and I hope you do!

17973080386646513;"Every differing opinion is an opportunity to learn.

It’s ok to not agree with everyone. 

It’s ok to smile & respect that we think differently.

It’s ok to tease each other about it (a little) too.

It’s NOT OK to break friendships, family bonds or bully people into thinking the same as us.

Is (y)our ego so big & fragile that it makes us think that we’re special and “I’m 100% right and everyone else that thinks differently is wrong”?

Truth: I’m / You’re not smarter than everyone else.

Truth: If someone’s opinion throws me/you off balance, we already had an imbalance.

The biggest question is: Why does it bother me so much?

Truth: If it touches a nerve, it’s for a reason.

I often find that when someone’s opposing opinion “bothers me” there’s a specific a reason or a wound to heal. 

That means something needs work inside of me. There’s an opportunity for growth. To be better! 

I then reflect and resolve in my morning silence.

I also question where I got that belief from.

How did I form it?

Was it from a valid source that got it from a valid source? 

Was it from someone I respect (that couldn’t possibly be wrong!) ;)

Was it something iI heard on TV?

Or was it something I *properly* researched myself without bias to an outcome?

Regardless, I’ve learnt. Learnt fast. 

Since doing Instagram every day for several years, getting haters & many people telling me “YOURE WRONG” or “THIS IS BS” I’ve learnt to appreciate differing opinions and respond, not react.

I’m posting this:

1. For fun. 
2. To hold myself accountable to continue in this way
3. For you guys to call me out where relevant

Remember, every different opinion is an opportunity to learn, not to convince.

18007787431504868;"🏫Book Review🏫

The School for Good Mothers by Jessamine Chan

“I am a bad mother, but I am learning to be good.”

This book wasn’t for me. I see what it is trying to say about motherhood, but sadly it didn’t work for me. 

Frida does something a mother should never do. And what she did was objectively horrible, not just a minor infraction. She loses parental rights until she spends a year at a school for bad mothers to see if she can learn to be better. The premise of this is great. We mothers are judged everyday, especially under the scrutiny of social media.

This was well written commentary on what it’s like to be a mother. Some of the mothers were sent to the school for ridiculous reasons like complaining on Twitter about their child or smothering their teenage son too much. If Frida had done something like this, instead of what she did, I would have enjoyed this more. I think that’s the point though, to contemplate whether the punishment fit the crime, but I couldn’t connect with the MC at all. 

This book will definitely leave a mark and make you think. I would be interested to hear other perspectives from mothers and non mothers. I originally gave this 2 stars, but I’ve upped it to 3 because I still recommend reading it. 

⭐️⭐️⭐️/5

Do you have to be able to sympathize and connect with the MC to enjoy a book? I do in most circumstances.

17947046207564575;"Feliz día del padre, ah no. Perdón. Los hombres son malos, nos violan, nos matan... 
Vamos a cambiarlo y a poner el día del perro...
En serio ¿en qué momento os habéis creído que todas estas tonterías son ""feministas""?
Porque no lo  son, o igual el feminismo ha cambiado tanto que ahora es hembrismo...
No lo sé... pero ya no me representa porque parece que solo barre para un lado y se olvida de su verdadero significado que es la igualdad, y si ya no significa eso que por favor la RAE lo cambie.
Como de momento sigue siendo el Día del Padre voy a  romper una lanza por las discriminaciones que ellos también sufren, por los buenos (que ya sabemos que hay malos, igual que hay madres malas aunque esté prohibido decirlo). 
No hay colegio que se precie sin grupo de WhatsApp, lo curioso que mayoritariamente en esos grupos tan divertidos sólo hay madres, más que nada porque con ellos no se cuenta. 
En una separación siempre salen perjudicados, se pueden quedar sin nada, en la calle y pagando unas pensiones que les impidan levantar la cabeza en la vida.
Otro tema tabú, las denuncias falsas existen. Y eso no significa que las verdaderas no, pero que haya maltratadores de verdad no resta que también haya mucha aprovechada que le destroce la vida a un tío sin una pizca de empatia. 
Y puedo seguir, pero os diré una cosa, yo también tengo miedo de que a mis hijos les toque una hdp que los hundan y quitar el Día del Padre no es la solución. Hay muchos días para celebrar el Día de las familias especiales, que por supuesto lo merecen, sin necesidad de quitar el mérito a nadie. 
Lo que hay que hacer es luchar por la Igualdad REAL, sin excepciones, y criar en el respeto y dejarse de tonterías porque llega un momento que cansa escuchar que se mete a todos en el mismo saco. 
Por cierto, en la Igualdad real no hay entrada gratis para las chicas en las discotecas, ni otros beneficios que tenemos simplemente por ser mujeres.

Firmado una feminista, creo

⭐️⭐️⭐️ 3.5

So I know this is an unpopular rating as this one has been so popular, and though I didn't absolutely love this one, I also didn't hate it. So hear me out...

This was a grumpy sunshine, work place romance with the best setting! I loved the Dreamland background and everything set up for this one. I enjoyed the characters but just didn't really connect with them. I didn't feel the chemistry between the main characters like I wanted to. I felt some parts dragged on, which made it a bit slow for me.

I did, however, enjoy the setting and the dynamic of Zahra's character. I feel like this could have been such a great book, but it was just lacking in some areas for me. I'm still looking forward to continuing with the series.

17868024338852035;"Jaką książką wchodzicie w nowy miesiąc? 

***
Pomimo wieku lubię czasami sięgnąć po powieść młodzieżową, ponieważ wśród ogromu średniaków i słabszych pozycji, można trafić na perełki, które zachwycą nawet dorosłych. Kolejny raz zabrałam się za twórczość znanej i lubianej Alice Oseman... 

""Solitaire"" to generalnie zwyczajna, prosta młodzieżówka, ale Oseman tak poniosła wyobraźnia i chęć przedstawienia różnych tematów na niewielkiej ilości stron, że mam wrażenie, iż nie dość, że ja totalnie nie pojęłam, co autorka miała na myśli, tworząc ten utwór, to sama pisarka pogubiła się w tym wszystkim. Pierwszy raz po powieści młodzieżowej czuję, jakbym nie miała bladego pojęcia, co tu się zadziało. Mocno czuć tu debiut, aż trudno uwierzyć, że ta sama autorka stworzyła przewspaniałe ""Radio Silence"" oraz przeurocze ""Heartstopper"". 

Zupełnie inaczej pamiętam Tori z ""Heartstoppera"" - tutaj jest niesamowicie antypatyczna, jej zachowanie jest irracjonalne i ewidentnie potrzebuje pomocy specjalistów. Niestety dużym problemem jest tutaj brak uświadomienia młodszym ludziom, że postępowanie bohaterów jest tutaj złe, a niekiedy wręcz toksyczne i nie powinno mieć miejsca w realnym życiu. Tak jak ja nie potrzebuję takiego tłumaczenia, to grono młodych czytelników jak najbardziej, bo to oni są głównym targetem takich utworów. Po zamknięciu ostatniej strony nadal nie wiem, co Oseman chciała przekazać tą historią, ani o czym tak naprawdę była. A zakończenie... cóż, miłość jest piękna i potrzebna, ale niestety nie jest lekarstwem na całe zło świata, a zwłaszcza osobiste problemy, które powinno się przepracować. Słabiutko.

17966193310926370;"🛥 BOOK REVIEW 🛥
Luck and Last Resorts
By Sarah Grunder Ruiz
⭐️⭐️⭐️ 

♥️ Thank you so much to berkleypub for this #gifted copy.

😅 Q: What was your last unpopular book opinion?

Mine: I picked this book based on its gorgeous cover, but the inside didn’t match the outside for me.

It’s about Nina - a former Olympic gymnast-turned-yacht staff worker. She’s bitter about just about everything. And Ollie, and Irish man turned yacht chef. They have been on again off again for a decade. Now, on their last yachting season together, Ollie wants Nina to commit or he’s headed back to Ireland.

🛥 My take:
I enjoyed the yacht setting and getting a peek behind the scenes at how a team works together on the boat. (I actually wish there would have been a little more of this)! I also adored Ollie as a main character. He was the perfect balance of salty and sweet. He had a gruff exterior, but a heart of gold. I loved how Grunder Ruiz let him shine in little moments, such as chatting with an upset crew mate, cooking for others, or planning dates.

😵‍💫 However, for all that Ollie is good, I struggled a lot with Nina. She’s a complex character with a lot of family and former gymnastics related trauma. But my biggest problem with her is that she doesn’t have any redeeming qualities. In order for me to fall in love with a main character, or at least root for their redemption arc, I have to find something I like about them. Nina was bratty, rude, and was proud about being mean to her crew. At one point in the story Nina says she and Ollie are just alike–but they aren’t at all. Ollie was gruff and quiet, but kind. Nina was, well, none of those things. And she played with Ollie’s affections for years and years, constantly stringing him along. 

Three star average: five stars for Ollie and the boat, one star for Nina and her infuriating personality.";2022-10-10 13:23:30+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:25.969077+00:00;75;827;en
17938431233366610;"Now, don’t get me wrong, the song doesn’t necessarily sound *bad* and I still like it a bit, but it could’ve been so much better. Mostly my issue is just that almost the whole second half of the song is the same melody over and over again. The first half sounds so good with the first verse and chorus and then the second verse and chorus but then the chorus is repeated so much that I end up skipping the song halfway through whenever it comes up in my playlist. I just wish there were like another verse or a bridge or something because it becomes very hard to listen to after a while and there’s so much wasted potential.

17931215843544239;"🐺 Furia 🧛🏼

Hoy os traigo la reseña de «Furia», segunda parte de la saga «Crave», de Tracy Wolff y publicado por la editorialplaneta

🐉 Como es una segunda parte, no voy a revelaros nada de la trama. Una cosa que me choca bastante de estos libros es que, a pesar de tener sus 700-800 páginas, el tiempo que pasa en el libro es muy poco. Y muchas veces se me ha hecho un poco repetitivo y pesado.

Con este libro tengo una opinión bastante impopular porque prácticamente a todo el mundo le encanta, entienden mucho mejor a Grace, etc. En mi caso, me ha gustado menos que el primer libro y Grace me ha parecido más insoportable. Jaxon tampoco me ha gustado nada.

Si bien es cierto que aparece un nuevo personaje bastante interesante, creo que el fandom (como siempre) se carga la sorpresa que podría haber. Ya antes de leerte el libro, con todos los comentarios sobre él, puedes saber de sobra quién es.

Tengo BASTANTE curiosidad con respecto a unos hechos que se mencionan en el libro pero que no se llega a profundizar en ellos. Y quizá eso sea lo único que haga que en el futuro me anime a seguir con la saga, aunque no será en un futuro cercano.

Lo bueno de estos libros es que, aunque sean buenos tochos, enganchan un montón y se leen muy rápido. Pero ya ver el tamaño impone un poco 😅

Your mindset is 90% of the battle, the other 10% we have absolutely no f%^king control over. 

A situation can’t make you pissed off or depressed unless you give it the power to. 

So why sit there with excuses for excuses and not do anything to change? 

Put 👏 in 👏 the 👏 WORK 

This doesn’t mean it’s going to be sunshine and rainbows 24/7, this doesn’t mean you won’t fail, this doesn’t mean that there won’t be setbacks, this doesn’t mean that you won’t have to pick yourself back up out of that shitty mindset again

But, you need to do something different than you currently are cause that shit ain’t working and the only who can do that is YOU. 

Only you can make that change within ✨

Δεν τρελάθηκα με την Ερνό.
.
Γεια σας, φιλ@ μου! 
Ίσως επειδή κρυώνω, μου έρχεται να σας ρωτήσω πώς θα ζεσταθείτε αυτόν τον χειμώνα. Τέλος σπάγκων...
.
Στα πλαίσια του εργαστηρίου δημιουργικής ανάγνωσης, που παρακολουθώ στο βιβλιοπωλείο Booktalks, διαβάσαμε τη φετινή νομπελίστρια, Αννί Ερνό, κάτι που ήθελα να κάνω έτσι κι αλλιώς.
.
Γενικά και προσωπικά, δεν τρελαθήκαμε από αυτήν την ξερή γραφή. Το μόνο αξιοσημείωτο γι' αυτό το ύφος χωρίς καλολογικά στοιχεία και φιοριτούρες, οι οποίες συχνά μπορούν να κουράσουν τον αναγνώστη, είναι ότι αναδεικνύει το περιεχόμενο, στην προκειμένη τον αγώνα του πατέρα της να καταξιωθεί κοινωνικά και η σχέση της μαζί του.
.
Συζητήσαμε, επίσης, για το θεσμό των βραβείων της σουηδικής Ακαδημίας, τα οποία δεν έχουν σαφή λογοτεχνικά κριτήρια και συχνά αδικούν κόσμο, καθώς η ίδια η Ακαδημία έχει παραδεχτεί ότι δεν βράβευσε τον Καβάφη επειδή ήταν γκέι. Νομίζω ότι τα κριτήριά τους είναι κυρίως πολιτικά και η φετινή βράβευση έχει να κάνει με την απαγόρευση των αμβλώσεων στην Αμερική και με αφορμή την ταινία για το Γεγονός, που προβλήθηκε φέτος στους κινηματογράφους. Αυτό, βέβαια, είναι καλό από φεμινιστική κι ανθρώπινη άποψη (ο φεμινισμός, όπως κι ο υπαρξισμός, είναι ανθρωπισμός), αλλά δεν προσδίδει ιδιαίτερο κύρος στο Νόμπελ λογοτεχνίας.
.
Θα ξαναδιαβάσω Ερνό, γιατί τα βιβλία της διαβάζονται εύκολα και θέλω να βεβαιωθώ ότι δε μου διαφεύγει κάτι, αλλά δε θα περιμένω πολλά.

Έχετε διαβάσει τη συγγραφέα; 
Είδατε την ταινία, που βασίστηκε στο βιβλίο ""Το γεγονός"";

🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧: Hey booktribe!
How are you spending your weekend? Any nice plans?
.
I just read A Man's Place by Annie Ernaux, this year's Nobel laureate, but wasn't thrilled. I believe that the real reason for this prize was the abortion law in the US, since she has also written the Happening, which was turned into a movie released this year.
.
Have you read her or watched the film?

All Rhodes lead here - Mariana Zapata
I’d rate it 3/5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️

“The people we lose take a part of us with them… but they leave a part of themselves with us too.”

I kept switching between the ebook and the audio version for this one. The narration was not good ! So I ended up reading most of it as opposed to listening to it. The characters are so loveable! The story is beautiful and there are some really funny scenes that I loved. But the reason I couldn’t rate it any higher was because of the length of this book. And I know that many readers love a good slow burn romance but it just isn’t my cup of tea. It is too slow ! I felt like there was nothing much to the story except just 572 pages of everyday stuff happening in the characters’ lives. And I personally like a good story as well as more meaning to a relationship! So even though, this wasn’t for me, there are many great reviews on this book so I’m sure a lot of readers would love it ! It is available on kindle unlimited !

17980886929667042;"📖 R E V I E W 📖

QOTD: What was that one hyped up book that didn’t sit well with you? (It’s a safe space here ❤️)

I’m tad bit late for the review. I was done with this book way back. 😅 The beautiful bookmark is from pustakamsvargah and that stethoscope is mine. 😊

Okay this is an unpopular opinion. If you loved this book…you can skip the review part. 🫣

Review:

Coming to the review, I really wanted to like this book. Hear me out…it has got south Asian rep, that enemies to lovers trope and the male MC is a doctor. How much desi you can get? 🤭

I initially thought Kareena, the MC to be a strong and independent woman. Sigh…why did I get my hopes high up fast. 🥲 She had potential to be a great character; unfortunately it just slipped away. I just found her annoying most of the time. 

Talking about Prem, he is a freaking cardiologist but objectifies women he sees over at the bar. 🚩 I wouldn’t even rate him a 10 material. 🙄 Probably desi aunties would adore him; not me. 😌 Andddddd he names his d*ck! Omg! For the love of God; please don’t. 🤦🏽‍♀️ He was basically a 🚩 that the author attempted to turn into a dream boyish kind. Oh my…the bar is beneath the earth’s crust isn’t it??! 

This is your typical plot you may watch over any Indian movies. ‘Gangsta-vibe’ boy…chasing (or stalking) after so called strong an independent woman. 😅 

Overall, I still gave a 3 stars…maybe it should have been a 2. 🤭 If you are into those Indian romantic comedy type of films (with cringey steamy scenes)..this book would be a delight for you. The rest can just perhaps skip this. I’m doing all a favour here. 🫣 

*This review is solely my own opinion. I’m not responsible for any desi aunties; who might be hurt for thrashing their golden boy. 😜

18262817866176613;"Another audiobook finished! 

I had heard great things about this book, but it didn’t live up to the hype for me. Maybe because the description was “heartbreaking and hilarious” while I didn’t find anything in this book hilarious. At all. It’s pretty much just heartbreaking what she went through starting her life as a child actor. 

And maybe because I listened to the audiobook, which she narrates, and that it sounded like she was bored/uninterested in telling her story. 

But that’s just me. I hope for her that she’s finally finding what she needs to be happy. It truly was heartbreaking hearing what she dealt with growing up.

17934397031332800;"Questa volta Milan Kundera sarà riuscito a fare breccia nel mio cuore? 🏷 

In questo ""saggio romanzato"" sono due le storie che proseguono parallele, una ambientata nel passato e una nel presente. Queste contrariamente alle leggi della matematica andranno ad avvicinarsi sempre di più fino ad intrecciarsi. Sono due storie di seduzione e passione, in bilico tra ragione e follia! 

I libri di Kundera mi ispirano sempre un sacco a partire dai titoli: ""L'insostenibile leggerezza dell'essere"", ""La lentezza"", ""Il valzer degli addii"", non sono accattivanti? 

Trovo anche interessanti e profonde le riflessioni che si susseguono nel corso della narrazione, ma alla fine chiuso il libro rimango delusa!
Delusa perché io mi creo delle aspettative troppo alte, perché spero di trovare un libro indimenticabile e, invece, alla fine dico ""belle le riflessioni, ma poi mi ricorderò di questo libro?"". 

La lettura resta godibile, ma per me non è un capolavoro 🤷🏼‍♀️ 

– Quanti ammiratori di Kundera? Perché vi piace?
– Avete letto questo libro? Cosa ne pensate?
– Quali autori hanno deluso le vostre aspettative?

17942699570614805;"Let’s talk Shadow and Bone Season 2. Huge spoilers ahead, obviously. And angry ranting. And potentially unpopular opinions. 

Season 1 was great. I wasn’t mad about what they did with the Crows’ storyline, but I was like okay, I can deal with this, it’s fine. It’s probably just me. Everything else was great and their casting is spot-on. Absolutely no complaints there. So, like many others, I went into Season 2 with excitement. I knew I had to expect some level of deviation from the books, but I was not prepared for the utter ruination and slaughter that was to come.

I have questions. So, so many questions - mainly, WHY. Why did they do this? Why did they have to destroy the character arcs? Where are they going with it? How could Leigh let them do this? What is their goal? Someone MAKE IT MAKE SENSE.

I am utterly devastated right now. I can’t remember ever having watched anything that deviated so horribly from the source material for no apparent reason. Everything about it just felt WRONG. 

David dying? Alina getting engaged to Nikolai? Alina’s powers changing like that, when she was supposed to go live in peace after killing the Darkling? All the unnecessary new characters, and absence of important characters? The Crows storyline getting twisted so badly that the CK events are happening before SOC? Leaving Matthias to wallow in prison for an entire season? Kaz and Inej’s storyline getting absolute destroyed? TOLYA AND INEJ?! WHAT THE HELL?

I am having a very physical, visceral reaction to all of this. I feel sick to my stomach and I don’t know when I’ll be able to recover from this. This might seem overly dramatic, but I don’t care: it literally feels like I’m grieving.

This is NOT my Shadow and Bone. These are NOT my Crows. 

Now excuse me while I go reread the books (again) just to regain some sense of sanity.

17894331602712563;"""Farsa de amor a la española"" de Elena Armas. 
Marcapáginas de resinaconencanto

No sé cómo empezar esta reseña... Digamos que no ha sido lo que me esperaba. A pesar de que el título no me llamaba la atención para nada, decidí darle una oportunidad por las buenas reseñas que había visto, por conocer a la autora y porque pensaba encontrarme una romcom de lectura ágil y muy divertida. Sin embargo, me he encontrado con una romcom bastante floja para mi gusto. Las escenas de comedia han sido para mí escasas y no demasiado graciosas. Si juzgase solo la parte de romance, me quedaría una historia de amor que se cuece a fuego demasiado lento para mi gusto, para luego concluir en unas escenas eróticas un poco forzadas y precipitadas, y con diálogos poco afortunados (no quiero dar detalles pero a mí esos comentarios dominantes que hace el protagonista no me resultan atrayentes para nada).
En resumen, la historia prometía al principio pero la segunda mitad del libro se me ha hecho repetitiva y no veía el momento de que terminase. 

2'5/5 para mi decepción de amor a la española 😅

17897777357764291;"Unpopular opinion.

I think niod SDSM2 is overhyped. There I said it.

Let's say I do believe in it's antioxidant and anti-aging powers, I can't say it's definitely working here after using it only for 4 months. But ok, I want to believe it does.

When it comes to targeting dryness I find it's really mediocre. I do miss this instant hydration I get after using for example Luneia Drench Dew, JSS Hydrate the Mist or Apothaka Skin Quenching Essence. I know it's different categories but still, to me it's one step- I either use a mist or an essence.

Now the thing that makes me feel a bit MEH about it is that I cannot use it when my skin is irritated (the kind of irritation when you stop all actives but any other skincare is ok to use). So when my skin got first annoyed with BPO and then my sinusitis destroyed my skin around the eyes I was really surprised to find SDSM2 stung like a ...beeeeep...

Anyway, it probably IS one of those 'invest in future skin' type of product that works quietly but I want to be able to use it every day, even when my skin is not feeling best.

After 4 months of use I'm only halfway through the bottle so it isvery efficient. PAO is 6 months so I'll have to start spraying it all over my body now to use it up in time.

Have you tried SDSM2 mist? Let me know what you think about 😘

17959845034923420;"Unpopular opinion: Escape room gratis? No, grazie!
Chi ci segue da tempo, sa bene che il nostro obiettivo è sempre stato quello di far ripartire questo settore, che si è ritrovato tra le categorie più colpite durante la pandemia. 

Se io giocatore esperto/blogger, pretendo che il Master non mi faccia pagare la stanza, magari sperando in un ritorno di pubblicità attraverso la recensione, come fa il Master a ripartire? Con cosa paga l'affitto, le utenze, il personale, le tasse derivanti dall’attività, i costi anticipati per la realizzazione delle stanze?
Certo è capitato ci offrissero stanze gratis, a seguito di una recensione; abbiamo sempre ringraziato per il gesto, rifiutato e pagato. Neanche quando la stanza era stata particolarmente deludente o pericolosa (si avete letto bene) ci siamo mai permessi di chiedere uno sconto.
Anche perché, mi chiedo, se è vero che “a caval donato non si guarda in bocca”, con quale libertà e coerenza è possibile recensire una stanza che magari non ti è piaciuta o che sconsiglieresti proprio? Verrebbe a crearsi di per sé una situazione abbastanza imbarazzante e spiacevole, nonché un conflitto d'interessi.
A volte capita che, giocando magari molte stanze insieme ed il master ha piacere (comunque mai su nostra richiesta), un piccolo sconto si possa pure accettare; ripeto piccolo, perché è capitato anche di rifiutare uno sconto che secondo noi era troppo elevato rispetto al costo della stanza.
Per noi il lavoro è un valore e come tale va retribuito. È un pensiero in cui crediamo fortemente e non solo uno slogan. Unica eccezione alla quale cediamo, ma comunque con difficoltà, é quando ci viene richiesto un beta test della stanza ancora chiusa al pubblico.
Se questa condotta sembra poco plausibile, ti sfido a contattare tutti i Master con cui abbiamo giocato, per verificare se le cose che abbiamo detto sono vere.

Questo è un nostro pensiero! Sbaglieremo? Amen!

18076525876344096;"Even though they're supposed rivals with everyone's favorite vocal synthesizer/virtual singer, Hatsune Miku (due to a similar mobile rhythm game structure), and are under the BanG Dream/Bandori brand, I feel like people are turned off by them, though obviously, they're probably for a more niche audience. I mean, POPY and ROSE deserve just as much love as big named vocal synths already do and it pains me that they're not getting that much love. The BanG Dream AI Singing Synthesizer series, I feel, has been embraced more by amateurs rather than a lot of big name producers. Only a handful of bigger producers have picked them up. Heck, kemu, who has created a lot of hits with GUMI and Miku, has used POPY and ROSE, and they're still not embraced by the greater vocal synth community as much. I feel like they're two of the most realistic voicebanks in a long time that need love too!

18254736223191903;"Unpopular opinion. There’s no excuse for sending emails out of office hours or on weekends.

Hear me out because this has nothing to do with the ‘if you’re sending emails before 9am or after 6pm you’re communicating that you have poor time management’ argument.

I think it was on timferriss podcast a while ago where the case was made for sending out-of-hours emails being selfish.

We can probably all agree that we feel stressed, particularly by work, and it was suggested on this show that when you send an email you have no idea how it’ll be received or what stress response the recipient may have.

I know I don’t need to read the body of an email, just seeing there is one from a particular person can make me think, ‘Oh, what now?’

And yes, perhaps the first thing people will say is ‘Well, you don’t have to read the email!’ but we’re all on our phones so much they’re hard to avoid. And who, these days, has two phones - one for work and one for life? It’s too much hassle.

I also know, from numerous conversations I’ve had on the podcast, that so many of us struggle to switch off from work and actually relax and disconnect from ‘work mode’, so an email that makes you feel better for sending could make someone feel a little worse for receiving.

Someone told me this week that they have a disclaimer on their email saying something along the lines of ‘I send emails when I get the time but don’t expect you respond immediately’ but I wasn’t sure, based on the argument of how an email will be received, that holds much weight.

I don’t work a 9-5 and often get to my emails in the evening but I schedule all my messages to leave my outbox at 8:59am ever since I heard that podcast with Tim. 

I’ve used a plug-in called mailbutler for a few years to schedule my emails and it’s a game-changer.

I’m curious to know what you think. Does it matter when you send emails?

I get it that some people loved the struggle to making vsynths work, but producers just want results. SynthV is very convenient and accessible, so people use it for better flexibility. We should be glad that it has cross language synthesis and built in vocal modes all for less than $100 USD. Struggling to make vsynths work is 10 years ago. If anything, we should be receptive to change. AI vsynths is going to stay. If people still wanna use outdated software, feel free to do so! Some people still use V1.

⭐️⭐️⭐️

Buddy read with my favs : nuclearfiction sparetimereader catsandbookstacks ❤️

Usually I find romcoms are great bingable page turners. But unfortunately I just found this book incredibly drawn out and the chapters were super long with so much unnecessary filler , making me lose interest frequently. I found the characters and their banter just mediocre and couldn’t fall in love with their story. 

The beginning started off strong and I chuckled a few times, but the humour dropped off the cliff and became nonexistent about half way through. 

I really enjoyed the side story of January’s father and the loss she lived through. The letters from her father definitely tore at the heartstrings a little. The ending was cutesy cutesy. 

But, overall, I just feel indifferent towards this book. Will still try reading People We Meet On Vacation at a later time, maybe I I’ll enjoy that one more than the two I’ve read so far!

What’s your favourite Emily Henry book?

Tw: death and loss

Katy loses her mother to cancer. In an attempt to find closure and clarity in her grief, she embarks on the vacation she was planning with her mother, had she ever recovered. Leaving her husband and life behind, Katy goes to the beautiful Amalfi Coast, Italy, where she traces the footsteps of her mother’s youth and learns more about the woman who gave her life. 

I wanted so badly to love this book but, I just didn’t. The whole concept of Katy being so attached to her mother that she refers to her as the love of her life, while treating her husband who supports her through thick and thin like garbage because he isn’t her mother is just confusing. I get that grief makes us do weird things but it was like Katy had no other idenity to her outside of being her mother’s daughter. 

As she learns more about her mom in her younger years, Katy then gets upset that there was more to her mother’s life than Katy. It was like she was flabbergasted that her mother wasn’t as obsessed with her. 

The best thing about this book is the quaint village of Positano, the beautiful Amalfi Coast and the grand Hotel Poseidon along with it’s kind and helpful staff. The writing puts you right there on the beautiful Italian beaches, basking in the sun. 

I generally favour books set in Italy but this one was a miss for me.

✨A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara✨

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️
Genre: Literary Fiction

Let me make it clear that I did not like this book, nor do I recommend it. Moreover, the author's personal views on mental health and trauma are morose, ableist, and offensive. The reason I'm giving this book three stars is because it's an effective study in hopelessness and despair and loss, and because it has the audacity to unequivocally exist. When Hanya Yanagihara said that she wanted to create the book version of an ombré cloth with A Little Life, I believe her. She has depicted the inevitable tragedy and slow doom of an individual in the modern world, and those last 200 pages were exquisite. This book is precise but miserable, and I have a difficult time finding what anyone likes or finds remotely inspiring about it. But whatever.

Jude is less of a character than a puppet that exists solely for the author to inflict absolute pain, suffering and hardship on like some sort of sadistic god determined to constantly fling him about like a rag doll. The story feels simultaneously hollow and yet over-described. The incidents that comprise Jude's childhood and adult trauma are depicted in a hyperbolic, ludicrous and almost cartoonish way that lends no credibility to them. 😒

The redemptive aspect of this book is Hanya Yanagihara's beautiful prose and style. As someone who loved The People In The Trees, I can absolutely see that she is a genius writer, albeit one who has chosen to employ her skills to give us 800 pages of false hope, repetition, and melodrama. All for what? Because she believes that some people are ""so broken"" that there is ""only one inevitable end for them"" since they ""cannot be healed"" and are ""too damaged"". Her words, not mine.

18040037452380400;"⁉️ QOTD: What are your bookish pet peeves?

Possibly an unpopular opinion incoming, but I didn't enjoy this book. 🫣 I liked In My Dreams I Hold a Knife by this author so I was really looking forward to her latest thriller, but... NOPE.

This book has so many of my bookish pet peeves all in one place:
📚 Repetitive scenes. Felt like I was reading about Shay going to a weird cult party, witnessing/experiencing abuse, then going back to the hotel and recording a podcast episode with Jamie... over and over again. From 30% to 80% it's this same formula repeatedly.
📚 Dumb MC. Like, girl, stop doing the same thing and expecting a different result I am-- 🤦‍♀️ 
📚 Unrealistic as hell. There's just no way anyone can convince me that Shay would be able to infiltrate this super secret powerful cult undetected. Also using an already misunderstood scene (bdsm) as the backdrop annoyed me. 
📚 One dimensional characters. I know nothing about Shay's husband or Jamie really. They're just kind of existing as an extension of her character. ✨ 

I'm also at the point where I'm going to stop reading thrillers with the 'true crime podcaster investigates' trope. They're all the exact same.

I'm being spicy with this one only because I expected a lot more given everything I've heard about this book and my enjoyment of the author's previous work. Disappointed with this one!

The plot to this book is as wafer thin as Donald Trumps real hair line - and I can hand to heart say it holds to its roots in the “Hallmark” world of “weak plot development”.

The naïve nature of the characters had me eye rolling and wanting to laugh out loud at the absurdity.

There ARE SOME highlights to this book,

- acknowledging Bipolar disorder
- body inclusivity and the fat phobic nature of the entertainment industry
- the differences held between acceptability of male and female sexuality

18055158688379588;"Never Never 

Charlie e Silas hanno perso la memoria e continueranno a perderla a cadenza costante, finché non riusciranno a scoprirne la causa non potranno liberarsi di quest’incubo.

La storia, scritta a quattro mani da Colleen Hoover e Tarryn Fisher, si divide in 3 parti che permettono di conoscere meglio i protagonisti. Nei capitoli si alterna la voce di Silas e quella di Charlie. Ho apprezzato la caratterizzazione del personaggio maschile, che ho trovato più incisivo all’interno della trama.
La seconda parte è quella che mi è piaciuta meno, a tratti anche infastidito in quanto vengono lasciate delle questioni irrisolte o messe un po’ a casaccio.
In alcuni punti l’ho trovato anche ripetitivo, non per la trama perché i protagonisti sono caduti in un loop infinito di amnesia, ma per il tipo di espediente narrativo, già utilizzato da Colleen Hoover nei suoi lavori precedenti. Anche qui, come in It ends e It starts with us, troviamo lettere e scambi epistolari tra protagonisti.

Quando tandemcollectiveglobal mi ha proposto di leggere questo romanzo mi spaventava la componente paranormale, mi immaginavano fantasmi, spiriti e chissà cos’altro - ma non c’è niente de genere, ve lo assicuro.
L’idea di partenza mi è piaciuta ma, con queste premesse, mi aspettavo qualcosa di più fantasioso e suggestivo per la risoluzione del mistero attorno a cui ruota l’intera vicenda, invece viene risolto in chiave troppo smielata e frivola per i miei gusti.
Per non parlare dell’epilogo finale…

Nonostante queste note dolenti non mi sento di dire che Never Never non mi sia piaciuto, perché non sono riuscita a staccare gli occhi dal libro, la Hoover mi fa quest’effetto, come per ognuno dei suoi romanzi letti fin ora, mi rapisce e catapulta nelle sue storie, ed è questo che cerco in una lettura.

🌸Penso di avervi detto tutto, se vi va, vi leggo sempre con piacere i vostri commenti.
Grazie per l’attenzione.🤗🌸

17852578211812333;"Happy birthday to Clive Owen! Clive played opposite Julia on two movies: Closer and Duplicity. Closer is actually one of my favorite movies, from the moment I first saw it. I had a little more trouble with Duplicity, had to watch it a couple of times to get the story. I really like it now, but I guess I’m just not that good with flashbacks. 😇

This could be an unpopular opinion, but of all of Julia’s leading men, I think Clive is my favorite. Not only is he tall, dark and handsome (and British), he also has a very mischievous smile and look on his face. Like he’s up to something and you have to stay on your toes the whole time. And those eyes…😊

Which one of Julia’s leading men is your favorite?

17918700161679704;"The Duke & I by Julia Quinn

Synopsis 
By all accounts, Simon Basset is on the verge of proposing to his best friend's sister, the lovely - and almost-on-the-shelf - Daphne Bridgerton. But the two of them know the truth - it's all an elaborate plan to keep Simon free from marriage-minded society mothers. And as for Daphne, surely she will attract some worthy suitors now that it seems a duke has declared her desirable. Their ruse works like a charm - at first. But as Daphne waltzes across ballroom after ballroom with Simon, it's hard to remember that their courtship is a complete sham. Maybe it's his devilish smile, certainly it's the way his eyes seem to burn every time he looks at her. It wasn't the plan, but it seems she's falling for the duke, for real. And amidst the glittering, gossipy, cut-throat world of London's elite, there is only one certainty: love ignores every rule.  
My Thoughts
This was February‘s #lilladiesbookclub It was one I was wary of as I didn’t get into the Bridgerton TV series. I did have some hope that I would be pleasantly surprised but unfortunately it was not for me. 

It was a very uneventful book. Nothing really happens. The spice in this book was dreadful and made me laugh. Every single character was annoying, cliche and had the personality of a spoon. I now totally get why the Duke wanted to die rather than marry Daphne, death would be a better option. What an irritating bore of a woman who was very manipulative and selfish. All the female characters just seemed ridiculous. I want some strong female characters I can get behind!

Simon was a self pitying sap of a man. I just don’t get how he had the reputation of being a rakish man? Did they mean he had the personality of a garden rake instead?

The writing was repetitive in its descriptions. Every other sentence seemed to comment on what position each characters eyebrows were in. As for a positive, the most I can come up with is it’s a quick read so I could thankfully escape the hell that I lived in whilst reading it. I can understand why romance readers love this series but I am not the audience for it. At least I tried right?!

It’s ironic I planned this post for today, as the #BOTY from #bookofthemonth was just released today, and Upgrade was on it, but alas, here we are. I am bringing some #unpopularopinion reviews of some recent BOTM books. Neither of these hit the mark for me, but I realize I am in a vastly small minority on that opinion. You know I am always bringing you the honest reviews though, even when those are less than glowing!

📖 Upgrade by Blake Crouch

💭 I absolutely loved Dark Matter and Recursion - they were brilliant works of sci-fi. However, Upgrade feels more like a discarded script from a cheap action movie. Things moved so fast, and not in an exciting way, but in a way that felt like Crouch was glossing over the details so you didn’t think too much about it. Not unique, not clever, not enough character development - overall a flat release from a typically magnificent author.

📖 When We We’re Bright and Beautiful by Jillian Medoff

💭 This one is going to hurt because I think I have only seen rave reviews… but omg I really disliked this book. You might remember the rant I went on about the woes of rich people - well, this one takes it to a WHOLE new level. The amount of privilege and disgusting lack of empathy these horrible, insipid people made me want to scream.

Read this book if you want to consider a fictional perspective of Brock Turner’s friends, family, and supporters, which let me tell you, I did NOT need in my life. Just one woman’s opinion. 🤷🏻‍♀️

The Night Circus was a highly anticipated read for me. I've heard nothing but amazing things about this book so naturally my expectations were through the roof. Well, they soared through the roof for the first few chapters and then it popped and floated down like a deflated balloon. 

The first chapters were very descriptive. Morgentern is a beautiful and descriptive writer which I normally lap up like candy. However, after a while it all just sounded the same and became redundant. By the middle of the book I was bored and couldn't maintain my focus. There were multiple POVs and the story time hopped so much that I got whiplash. I couldn't connect with any of the characters because they had no personalities. I found them to be flat and mundane. 

I did enjoy Celia and Marco's abilities and how their magic formed the Circus. What kept me going was the mystery of the challenge and how it would all come to an end. I wanted to know how the winner would be chosen. The last quarter of the book was enjoyable, and I was pleased with how it ended. I so wanted to fall madly in love with this book but unfortunately it fell a bit flat for me. Overall, I thought it was ok.";2022-07-07 13:24:16+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:27.665113+00:00;37;374;en
17963458187071865;"Paris is thrust into the spotlight when it is discovered she married comedy legend Jimmy Peralta. Now she is making headlines again because Jimmy is dead and she is the chief suspect. However  being a murder suspect is just one of her worries as someone is sending her blackmail letters threatening to expose a past she has worked hard to keep hidden.

This is the third of Hillier's books I have read and I see a definite pattern, unreliable female narrator with a dark event or someone dark from her past. Then alternate the chapters with past and present and there you have it. For this reason as much as the formula equates a page turner I never find there are many surprises along the way. Each book I have managed to guess an element of the reveal to come and this one was no different and I actually guessed it all. Things We Do in the Dark started off well but maybe because there was such a small cast of characters I had my suspect straight away (which was right) and then the rest of the events were interesting but I always seemed to be a few steps ahead and it was as if the story was catching up to me rather than the other way around. As much as I read thrillers all the time this has never happened before. I think if you are new to thrillers or want one to try the genre then this is a good place to start but for me it was too much like murder by numbers.

17966573635987639;"Unpopular opinion.

I love Alice Feeney's writing. Rock Paper Scissors will be one of my top reads of this year and of all time. Naturally, owing to this, I read her other books back to back. While most hit the mark, others fell short. 

When Daisy Darker was announced, I couldn't be more happier. I waited for it to be released in India and picked up the Kindle copy at an exorbitant price as soon as it was available.

This is the story of the Darker family, who are coming together after ages to attend the matriarch's 80th birthday. The venue is Sea Glass, Nana's gothic little house on an island that is only accessible during low tide. Nana happens to be an author who has written a book on Daisy based on her heart condition. Oh, Daisy was born with a heart condition that wouldn't let her live beyond fifteen. Or would it?

What happens when an estranged family comes together under a roof after a while? It gets ugly. Oh boy, how it does! As secrets are revealed, people drop dead. Random clues are left behind with messages. Trapped in this mansion until the tide goes down, who will be the one to get out alive?

Five point review of Daisy Darker by Alice Feeney:

1. Brilliant storytelling and writing. Alice Feeney is a master of this genre. But....

2. Rose, Lily, Daisy - sisters with secrets. Very caricaturish and silly. Daisy being the main protagonist, rarely feels like one.

3. Gives major And Then There Were None vibes. Thrilling yes, but doesn't make sense in so many ways.

4. Daisy and her heart condition. Something she seems to share with another member of the family. There is hardly any clarity on it.

5. I could see the twist coming from a mile. Ample Easter eggs are thrown around, but I did not expect a supernatural twist from Feeney.

Verdict: I don't know if it is this book alone or the fact that I've read quite a few thrillers of late that go the paranormal way, I did not enjoy this one.

Oggi vi parlo di Facciamo finta che mi ami di Elena Armas, contemporary romance pubblicato da Newton Compton il 30 maggio.

Le premesse erano queste:
«L’esordio di Armas è un capolavoro… Gli amanti delle rom-com rimarranno inchiodati.»
Publishers Weekly

«Se stai cercando una commedia romantica che ti rimarrà in testa per molto tempo dopo aver girato l’ultima pagina, questo è il libro che fa per te.»

Quindi mi domando: codeste persone hanno mai letto un romance in vita loro? Hanno mai visto, che ne so (i titoli citati non sono casuali), The Wedding Date con Debra Missing o letto The Hating Game di Sally Thorne? Perché inizio a nutrire forti dubbi, così come mi permetto di dubitare delle booktoker italiane che lo hanno definito ‘il romance migliore che abbia mai letto’. Posso, senza nemmeno sforzarmi troppo, trovare almeno 100 romance che per me sono migliori di questo e il motivo è semplice: Facciamo finta che mi ami non ha nulla di nuovo o incredibile che possa far urlare alla perfezione come avviene su TikTok.

E non mi fermo qui, perché ci sono mille ripetizioni, dal colore degli occhi del protagonista, alla sua prestanza fisica con muscolatura che viene descritta più e più volte. Elena lo abbiamo capito che Aaron Blackford è un gran manzo anche perché senza la sua presenza ci sarebbe ben poco. E anche se ho apprezzato il viaggio in Spagna e la famiglia invadente di Catalina questo non basta a farmi gridare ai quattro venti che un romance migliore non esista.

Mentre leggevo mi sono domandata molte volte se il problema potessi essere io, ho letto troppi romance? Sono assuefatta al genere? Non riesco più a trovare il bello nelle letture romantiche? Però sapete non credo sia questo, ma le aspettative che spesso vengono tradite. Se tu me lo definisci enemies to lovers io devo respirare a pieni polmoni questa dinamica, non deve essere blanda come in questo caso.

Women have (and continue to) get a rough deal in terms of how society is set up and whilst it would be easy to say we should celebrate them every day (which we should) that in itself is not enough to create the shifts that are needed to remove patriarchal ways and allow women to unapologetically play their part in the world.

17976886595041082;"📚 BOOK REVIEW 📚 

Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte

Be kind dear fellow readers. I have an unpopular opinion…

I did not like the favorite classic Wuthering Heights. I wanted to like it, I really did; but I did NOT. I was confused, bored, and perplexed for the whole of the book. I read this for my classics book club, which we discussed starting last night. They were kind to me despite my unpopular opinion and I hope you all will too. 

First of all, I struggled with the fact that it was told from the house keepers perspective, making it seem like she was everywhere for their whole life and how could this be true? I'm not sure, but maybe this is the reason that the story felt disjointed to me. 

I hated all of these characters. I know that this is somewhat the point. We're supposed to hate them, but I need to feel something to care what happens to these people and I didn't. The characters were tortured people, bringing out the worst in them. Heathcliff was a terrible person, but he was made so by his terrible past, his rejected love, and then his need for revenge. I didn't feel sorry for him and I just didn't feel the love that was supposed to be the main object of the story.

THE LAST HOUSEWIFE
By Ashley Winstead
⭐️⭐️💫

Dark. Disturbing. Bizarre. 

Okay. So, I finished this book last month then took some time to gather my thoughts and process how I truly felt about it. It's easy to get sucked into the buzz of a wildly trending book and I wanted to make sure my review reflected my most honest opinion. 

I know you've heard it before. This book is dark. I'm talking really dark. Dare I say, maybe even too dark? For me anyway. Which is saying a lot since I'm a thriller lover and literary fiction fanatic (two genres that generally contain a significant amount of heavy subject matter) But this book? It really affected my mental health.

There were points throughout when I considered DNF but since that's something I personally struggle with, I decided to just take a prolonged break, pick the book back up and continue to plod my way through. 

What I found really bizarre was that for the majority of this novel I was either horrified by the disturbingly graphic torture scenes or borderline bored throughout the rest. There wasn't much in between. The story itself felt sort of unbeliverable, as though it was intentionally over the top for the purpose of shock value. And to be honest, the whole female empowerment message was really lost on me. I didn't see that in the story at all. In fact, I saw the exact opposite of that. 

The plot really flipfloped between Shay saying she wanted to get to the bottom of her friends death but seeming to care very little about that as she focused more on her own desire for abuse and her fascination with the cult. I couldn't get a good grasp on the author's intention, the purpose of the story or what exactly it was trying to portray. 

Unfortunately, this book just wasn't for me and that's OK! Not every book is meant for every reader and my opinion on this novel is not going to stop me from reading In My Dreams I Hold A Knife because I've been wanting to read that one forever. 

I know I'm in the minority here so I'm curious... What is one book that you had an unpopular reaction to?";2022-09-11 13:42:27+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:29.314583+00:00;54;643;en

Despite being brave enough to share his honest and raw struggles with addiction, Matthew Perry's writing came across as repetitive and dull. He emphasized his fame too often, and the book felt poorly edited. I'm surprised it even made it to the best-seller list.

Well first off, i loved this shot at the beach on my trip and had to use it 😅 secondly thank you PRHAudio for the complimentary audiobook!

🎧 Audio Review 🎧

I saw bookclubwithkatelyn review just moments ago… and i agree with her assessment.. so check out her review too! 

This reminded me so much of Woman In The Window. For like 70% of the book. Then it does… a twist? Well it wasn’t exactly my fav direction but i went with it. 😒 i just don’t even. It was ok. I was into it but i wasn’t a fan of the last bit. And she drank SO much. 

I just have to be legit… i may lose points for this but fine. I feel like honesty is just always the way to go 🤷🏻‍♀️ here it goes.. I’m not a huge Sager fan. I think he’s just ok. But i keep trying him. I’ve noticed that he’s the type that tries for super over the top twists and that’s usually where he loses me. I’ve read 4 of his books and liked 1 😳 oh well. 

Am i the only one???? 

I think tho, if you’re a die hard Sager fan or you just like an off the wall twist. You might like this one. I didn’t hate it. But it was just ok for me. I gave it ⭐️⭐️⭐️

Also…. The narrator was great… but i felt a wrong choice for the character. The character seemed to be much younger than the voice. I kept thinking she was an older lady based on the audio. So it got confusing. 

Do you have a fav Sager book?

🎄 Ví muchos videos ""de humor"" y memes (incluso de influencers que sigo y aprecio) haciendo todo tipo de burlas sobre los cambios del cuerpo con las fiestas. Memes sobre personas con panza hinchada, gorda, rollos. No los comparto para no darles más visibilidad. 

😳 También ví propuestas medio mágicas para bajar de peso. Si estás leyendo esto y fuiste de esas personas la idea no es hacerte sentir mal sino aprender. No se hacen comentarios del cuerpo (ni de la dieta) de nadie. Porque generan dolor. Y estoy segura de que no querés generar dolor a la gente que te sigue y admira. Ni a tus seres querid@s. 

🤔 ¿Y si le digo que está linda? ¿Y si le digo que está flaca? No es no. Una no sabe si la otra persona está flaca porque está enferma, lo mismo si engordó. Este tipo de comentarios dañan y ponen al que los dice en un lugar de superioridad moral. ¿Quién soy yo para opinar sobre lo que come o viste pirula?

18213219478092189;"Good morning! I am comin in hot with a very unpopular opinion. Look away now if this is going to upset you.

I love TJR. Loved Evelyn, LOVED Daisy, really liked Malibu. I'm not a rookie. I nearly hated this book. I cannot recall the last time I disliked a character as much as I disliked Carrie Soto. Maybe that Caroline idiot from The Lost Apothecary? But she was at least a nice human, whereas Carrie is just a rage fueled robot. Listen...I was a mean girl once...it's real, real easy to spit out the nastiest thing you can think of...and it can feel good. But I was young then and I'm not anymore and neither is Carrie Soto and you just don't get to treat people like crap all the time. I mean you can but you can also shove your indignities when someone finally calls you a bitch.

Carrie is a retired tennis great who comes back to reclaim her record. Why? Because she is nearly incapacitated at the thought that anyone besides her can be great. It enrages her when anyone dares to suggest that another player is worthy of praise. I'm not being dramatic. She will tell off her father, tell off this nice man who loves her (for reasons I cannot fathom), kick...KICK, i tell you...the car door of her literal only friend when this woman says something that Carrie doesnt want to hear. Does Carrie apologize? No. She has no problem saying any nasty thing she thinks of but is consistently unable to make herself apologize. She is horrid.

What is even this book? Is Carrie insecure? Maybe. Does she have unresolved childhood trauma? Sure. Is this a feminist manifesto? If so, it failed for me. She's not just taking down the male haters. It's literally everyone. And really, after a certain age, you don't get to make all those excuses. It's not acceptable to behave that way. I don't think she was written all that well, very one-note for me. How many pages do you suppose were left when she finally started acting somehwat decent? And really, I thought it was boring. NOTHING happens. And the ending was predictable. Sigh😭.

Trust me...I wanted to love this book. No one is more disappointed than me. But I'll still be first in line for her next one!

17985245644862377;"Review: Things We Never Got Over by Lucy Score

Warning - unpopular opinion. 

Naomi Witt shows up in town running from her fiancé on the day of her wedding.  She comes because her estranged twin sister, Tina said she was in trouble and needed help.  Instead her sister steals her car, her purse and leaves Naomi with an 11 year old niece she didn’t know she had.  What will Naomi do now?  What type of trouble has Tina gotten herself into? 

Lucky for Naomi, the town hunk, Knox, has stepped in to help her.  As grumpy and rude as he is, he’s always there when she needs him.  Will their relationship blossom into more?  What is Knox hiding behind that rough exterior?

This book for me just way too long for what it was. The first 200-300 pages were too dragged out.  I think if the book had been 350 pages instead of 650, it could have been a lot better but you really don’t get anything out of about 300 pages so for me this was a miss. I know a lot of people really loved this book so I’ll just leave it at that.

17941104293601938;"HOW AUTOIMMUNE DIAGNOSES CAN BE WOUNDING

Unpopular opinion: autoimmune diagnoses can be severely wounding + induce shame. Here’s why👇

My initial reaction to receiving my first autoimmune diagnosis was a mixture of relief and dread. Relief that I wasn’t as crazy as many Dr’s made me out to be (and that’s a story for another day). 

But my second response was much more sinister. Shame set in immediately. 

The way the medical community explains autoimmunity is something like this: 

“Your body’s immune system is mistakenly attacking itself. It cannot tell the difference between what what is healthy and what is not.”

Just think about that for a second 🧐 

This description alone is enough to send any anxious, dysregulated, or overwhelmed person into a tailspin. 

Most of us with chronic illness already feel broken, and being told our body is attacking itself affirms this belief. 

It either induces or enhances shame, like we somehow caused this to happen. And that is just not right! 

I remember thinking that I had done something wrong. This must be all my fault. Why else would my body be working against me?

💌 It took me years to unlearn this correlation and make peace with my body again. Now I tech others how to love and support their body in just 8 weeks. DM me “BODY” to learn more ✨

17930838149512215;"Despite releasing an album just recently, I feel like not many fans of the English fandom (mainly the contemporary fandom and new fans in particular) have actually listened to Hachioji P’s works outside of songs like “Sweet Devil” or “RAD DOGS”. His album progression is so much fun to listen to from beginning to the end, but lots of his songs seem to drown in the sea of other Vocaloid songs. ViViD WAVE, his album from 2013, still feels so fresh even almost ten years later with tracks like “Dream Creator”, “Heart Chrome” “TRAP X TRAP” etc. , and these songs consistently have killer production quality and composition that I think many have forgotten in recent years. I also enjoy albums like “Last Dance Refrain”and “GRAPHIX” where it was constantly banger after banger after banger with songs like “Last Dance”, “Bitter Majesty”(which is also a sequel to Sweet Devil), “ACUTE” and “MINIMALIST” (which was a collaboration between Yuyoyuppe and Hachioji). Just listen to his albums, they’re fire

We've gone to marriage counselors, individual therapy, and have done inner healing. We aren't falling in love with each other daily. It's not an accident and someone pushed us off a cliff.

⭐️⭐️⭐️

QOTD: What is your favorite Jenna Bush Hager book pick?

I’m frustrated. This is the third book that I’ve read in the past few months that other people rave about and I struggle through it. It was a good book, but I wasn’t blown away with an “this is amazing” attitude. Am I too critical or does the hype leave me expecting more? 

Once again in my assessment of books I don’t love, but others do, I liked the premise. It was a heartbreaking situation, for sure. But I think I wanted more from that. The story was heartbreaking but I didn’t feel that emotion in the writing. The writing style focused so much vernacular for someone learning English in Nigeria that it lost the emotion. I also found I couldn’t read at my usual pace because I expected to read words that weren’t there due to the realistic syntax. This realism left me wanting more on the emotional end and I felt a disconnect between the two.

Synopsis 👉

I’m keeping this review short since everyone has picked up this book and it was a BOTM selection.

Brace yourselves, because here comes an unpopular opinion.

Well… nothing happens in this far fetched cat-n-mouse thriller until about the last 40 pages, and you’re also going to have to suspend belief as you read the majority of the story. Honestly, I was left kinda wondering what the mystery even was as I finished the book.

On the plus side this story has short chapters, so it reads fast even though it’s a slow burn.

Overall, this is an interesting and cinematic story. I wanted to know how it ended (which I guessed at about halfway) and that’s what kept me reading. I think this is one of those books you would want to read on an airplane or while traveling, because you don’t really have to invest yourself in it and it goes by quickly.

Glad mamas_top_shelf read this with me and had her to chat about the ending with!

The Change 
by Kristen Miller 

At last! I finished this book. I know many love this book and that is why I am going to take a moment and say, I see you. There were some things I liked. But ultimately…it just wasn’t for me. 

What I liked..
-It gave me a female superhero vibe with a cast of bad a** women, all that have their own super power. 
-I really like that the bond of friendship developed into sisterhood 
-I found Harriet to be a compelling character. She evolves so much in the story and for that it made her most interesting.
-It has a witchy magical realism vibe to it that makes it a good read for October. 

What didn’t work..
It felt sooo long. I don’t mind long books as long as they don’t feel long. It started strong and then…molasses. The last 25% I switched to audio and I did find that I enjoyed that portion more. So maybe this book is better on audio? I did think the narrator did a good job. 
-I also struggled with the amount of characters and backstories. So many of the characters felt redundant. All the men were pretty much portrayed the same—AWFUL and predatory. And the 1 or 2 that were decent are definitely more of an exception. I literally had a hard time telling characters apart because they were so similar. Overall, story just felt too predictable and contrived. 

So bottom line, you may love it (according to goodreads most do) but if you don’t love it, you see me 🙃.

Happy first day of fall!! I love the crisp air, fall foliage, cozy sweaters, comfort foods, and jeans for days. But we are climbing back to the 90s so it is feeling like fall is late this year. 😥

November 9
⭐️⭐️/5 

What I Liked: premise, train wreck factor

What I Struggled With: the characters, toxic romance, shock value plot points, the ending

SYNOPSIS:
After meeting at the age of 18 when neither of them was ready for a relationship but unable to ignore the instant spark, Fallon and Ben decide to meet every year on November 9th, no contact in between, for the next 5 years in the hopes this feeling isn’t just infatuation and they’ll find their way back to each other year after year. 

OVERALL:

Mm…yeah…it’s a no for me. 

Maybe if I had read this book when it was published in 2015 and I was a sophomore in college who drank too much and who’s bar for men was nonexistent, I would have found the “romance” in this book endearing and given it a better rating. However, in the year of our lord 2022 at my big age, that’s not happening.

I initially found the premise of this book interesting. Deciding to forgo a relationship in favor of finding yourself? Yes please! And Hoover’s books have great readability in that their quick and easy to read and you find yourself continuously turning the page. However, that’s where the warm and fuzzies for this book end for me.

Fallon is scarred, literally and figuratively. Instead of Ben’s manipulation, lies, and CRINGEY dialogue, she needed therapy, friends, and more engaged family members (her dad accidentally forgets her and leaves her in a burning building?? Wait what!?) .  Maybe if she had that, we wouldn’t have a book but I’d prefer no book to what I read 🤷🏾‍♀️ 

This book is pure shock value. The writing is mediocre. The depth is not there especially given the HEAVY topics. The ending is not the HEA any of us should have hoped for. This is not the warm and fuzzy romance that Hoover has positioned it to be. It is toxic. It is a sad. Justice for Fallon. Ben can choke. 

I appreciate the love everyone has for CoHo and I’m absolutely not trying to yuck anyone’s yum! But for me, this is a no and this is a safe space if it’s a no for you too! 😅

It'd be great if they did more songs outside of the popular ones, for example Lollyland Tour would probably sound amazing with the inkling like vocals of the project. And lastly there isn't really any Utaus in it other than Teto and there isn't really any SynthVs or any other programs vocals and they'd all sound really cool in it to. Idk the project was something I used to listen to all the time and it needs more appreciation and more coverage in the synth community.

18200656621202561;"Let's talk...expectations

The Whisper Man by Alex North has been on my shelf for far too long. It was part of my spooky tbr last year but I didn't get round to it so after continually seeing rave reviews I made sure it was top of this October's tbr. The lovely Natasa itsallaboutbooksandmacarons asked if I wanted to buddy read so we were both looking forward to starting October with a bang.

Unfortunately and we do seem to be in a little club of two but we didn't love this. It started off well but everything I have heard hinted at a scary and chilling thriller. So I waited and waited then something chilling happened and I thought here we go and then..it fizzled out. It was not a bad read but it didn't blow me away. When there is even a hint of scary in a review I go in with certain expectations and woefully I am more often than not left disappointed. In this instance I feel that if it had focused on the eerie then I would have enjoyed it more, but any scariness was lost along the way. There are two stories that interlink but I would have preferred if there had just been one done really well, rather than two done half heartedly. 

Perhaps if I had read this as a proof or early on in its release I may have enjoyed it more but I finished this book not really understanding the hype.

Thank you Natasa for the buddy chats as they were the highlight of this read.

What was the last book you read that didn't live up to your expectations?

I really hope they will be a just as popular duo as Kaito and Meiko were in their glory days. They even have matching design with the sun and moon theme

Additional Information: Upon reveal, there was much excitement toward the release of ASTERIAN based on the sound of his voice as his illustration was not yet shown. The user base often commented that he had a voice type that was rare within masculine voice synthesizer options, especially for the English language, with some users noting that most of the current lineup had trouble reaching very low notes, even for the deeper-toned ranges. Overall, the user base was glad that Eclipsed Sounds acknowledged the need for ASTERIAN's type of voice. ASTERIAN's design was very well received as his appearance was also considerably needed within the voice synthesizer lineup overall (Source: SynthV Wiki)";2023-03-25 05:38:02+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:31.371118+00:00;10;178;en

Wanting to work out and stick to foods that make you feel your best….

Is NOT a diet!!!!!!

It’s called living a life that makes you feel good! 

It’s feeling good in your own skin 

It’s relieving anxiety!!!

It’s about balance and still enjoying your favorites🎉

The word diet implies restriction.  That’s just not what I’m going to do.  I’m going to enjoy my m&ms, but first I’m going to make sure I’ve prioritized the foods that make me feel good!

🤔Internationale Vrouwendag.... is het niet eigenlijk één grote commerce zoals Valentijn of andere Awareness dagen ?

Want eerlijk ? Ja, er is nog te veel onrecht tegen vrouwen de dag van de vandaag, net zoals er nog te veel haat is tegenover verschillende groepen personen. 

Met slechts 1 dag per jaar, gaan we er niet komen... neen, als je verandering wil zien in je eigen leven of in de wereld, dan kan je beter elke dag opnieuw een actie, hoe klein ook, ondernemen om jouw leven of de wereld beter te maken. Want ja, die kleine actie van jou doet er echt wel toe...

Ik vernoem, denk ik wekelijks wel andere onderneemsters in mijn stories, ik geef oprecht om anderen en ik zal steeds mijn opinie geven over bepaalde gevoelige topics. 

Maar toch, ik heb niet 1 specifieke dag per jaar nodig om andere vrouwen op een podium te zetten. Ik doe dat elke dag, we zijn elke dag sterk ook als we zitten huilen in een hoekje zijn we sterk, we staan er en komen op voor onze mening en doen ons best om het verschil te maken.

Net zoals ik Valentijn nooit nodig heb gehad om aan mijn vriend te zeggen dat ik hem graag zie...

Dus ik roep vandaag op om ook morgen, volgende week, volgende maand, in juli, oktober en december, kortom zo vaak als mogelijk, vrouwen en ook andere personen te steunen, op een podium te plaatsen, acties te nemen om de wereld van iemand anders een beetje beter te maken met kleine of grootste gebaren.... 

Just sharing my humble opinion... 🦄

Lot's of love,💕

Ci sono libri che semplicemente non sono fatti per noi e Dio di illusioni è uno di quelli. 

Scritto nel 1992, la vicenda che una Donna Tartt ventottenne decide di narrare era innovativa all'epoca ma oggigiorno si ritrova ad essere invecchiata male: 6 rampolli che frequentano un prestigioso college americano bevono, si drogano e vivono la loro vita senza eccessive preoccupazioni. Sono capitanati da un professore classicista che assomiglia molto al professor Keating de L'attimo fuggente ma una versione più noir. Poi succede qualcosa che stravolge le vite degli studenti di questa specie di setta e da quel momento niente sarà più come prima e i legami che un tempo li tenevano insieme assomiglieranno a corde graffianti dalle quale è impossibile liberarsi. 

La prima parte è ben costruita: Richard, narratore della storia e outsider del gruppo, ci presenta i vari personaggi, delineandoli con precisione e dando loro tratti distintivi. Peccato che poi nella seconda metà tutto viene disfatto a favore della rincorsa al colpo di scena più inaspettato e alla rivelazione shock più inquietante. Con l'intento di seguire un ritmo accelerato, tipico del thriller, la storia perde infatti di forza e definizione, assomigliando al racconto di una di quelle feste universitarie in cui tutti hanno fatto sesso con tutti e qualcosa di brutto è successo.

Ampolloso senza motivo ed eccessivamente lungo, poco credibile in molti snodi della trama, di Dio di Illusioni ho apprezzato solo il titolo perché ha rispecchiato perfettamente quello che ho provato leggendolo: una grandissima illusione che qualcosa potesse migliorare quando invece era tutto perso sin dall'inizio.

The Other Mrs. by Mary Kubica

I have decided that this author isn’t for me. Sometimes I can get behind an outrageous plot twist, and other times it feels unearned and out of place. While I will say my tastes have changed, and I would’ve eaten this up 10 or 15 years ago. I obviously can’t give away what I’m talking about here, but this would have been right up my alley when I was younger. 

Another thing I will say is I binged this on audio. Even if I didn’t love it, it was insanely easy to listen to. I really enjoyed that overall experience and recommend going that route if you read it!

I think this is a me thing, so don’t let me sway you from reading it. And I would love to discuss with anyone who has read it!

(ARC)

Read this book if you like:
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 family drama
💁🏼‍♀️ a very self aware female MC
🤍 romantic comedies
✨ a light, easy read

What I loved:
Poppy’s commentary about her family throughout the book is honestly hilarious. You can relate and feel exactly how she’s feeling heading to her youngest sisters wedding and having to deal with her family dynamics. She seems to be the most level headed of all her family members and yet they judge her for her career choice. I giggled a lot just at the simple fact that this family was SO quirky!

What I didn’t love:
Truly I feel like there was more character development than there was plot. While I enjoyed the lightness of this book it did feel a little flat for me - I needed more drama or some turmoil! That being said I did really enjoy reading all the British jargon (as a Canadian) and I definitely need to read more books from British authors!

I enjoyed the movies of both “The Green Mile” and “The Shawshank Redemption” but all of the books I’ve attempted have fallen short for me. I find none of them particularly shocking nor scary nor thought provoking in any way. Due to his popularity, I desperately wanted to but it’s just not going to work I don’t think. I hope to read The Green Mile later in the year but then I believe I shall call it quits and stop trying.

17913221414593911;"AD/PR PRODUCT 📚 BOOK REVIEW

One of the first thing Persephone sees when she arrives at her new summer home are the boys next door. Jumping into the water without a care in the world looks very appealing. From then on Sam and Charlie are always in Percy's life..until they aren't. Years later she gets a phone call and she races back to Barry Bay without hesitation but then all the memories come flooding back.

After seeing nothing but rave reviews for this book I am going to go out on a limb and say I thought it was just ok. From the cover to the synopsis plus hearing nothing but good about this book I thought it was right up my street and perfect for enjoying out in the sun. It started off well and Percy and Sam's major break up is alluded to throughout so I was looking forward to reading about what led up to this but then I only had 40 minutes left to read and we find out and I was left thinking is that it? Even Percy and Sam's relationship throughout the years, their friendship worked and was interesting but any romance I felt was forced and flat. I did fall in love with Barry Bay and it's residents, especially Sue the hard working single mum to Sam and Charlie and would have liked to follow her life instead. I don't even think it was because I went in with high expectations of what this book would be that it didn't work for me I just think there was very little to it. I am all for a slow burn emotional story but this never ignited at all and I doubt I will remember Percy and Sam next Summer.

17974501072802727;"Come karvachauth & dressed up couple pictures, alongside comes endless views of how patriarchal & regressive the festival is. I observed my 1st karvachauth as per familial traditions, with utmost willingness & out of pure love for my partner. I feel that in our fast-paced lives, us career oriented women, barely have opportunities to display our love & if these traditions permit us to showcase our love in any way, why not? Further, I would love to be a part of the majority in this case and cherish the festive vibe & the sisterhood that follows during the Puja..

Consider parents who time and again are seen sacrificing their desires for the sake of being better providers for their kids… any kind of sacrifice is the purest form of love that there is! When love happens without seeking any rationale so can karvachauth be observed without such deliberations. Love is enough a reason for everything.. 

Traditions must be followed with tweaks to suit the society today but must not always be brushed aside in our quest for logic. Husbands may also choose to follow the bandwagon to fast!Traditions ground us with an optimum amount of obedience required to have a semblance of a lawful society at large. Our revolutionary selves could be allowed to relax sometimes for the sake of a ‘community feeling’.

Besides, I learnt that willpower wins over even natural phenomena like hunger & thirst.. Our mind is all powerful!

Tengo la esperanza de que no me bloqueéis ni me matéis por esta reseña, pero es una UNPOPULAR OPINION🙄

La premisa me parecía muy buena, y empieza bien, el principio es precioso🥺
Pero conforme iba avanzando menos sentido le encontraba a todo😅

No he conectado. Nada.
Mi problema es que no me he creído la historia ni los personajes.
Van de filósofos por la vida pero luego no tienen ni idea de lo que hacen, no ponen en práctica todas esas..""reflexiones"", pero hablar, hablan muchísimo🤦🏻‍♀️
Y me costaba😅

La historia, predecible y muuuuy repetitivo todo. De cara mitad al final me sobraba el 90% de páginas.
¿Y porqué no decirlo? Me esperaba algo más de ese misterioso ""Mapa de los anhelos""🙄
Aunque el final (epílogo) sí me ha gustado.

He leído muchas historias de duelo y la mayoría me encantan, esperaba que este también fuera así y no.
Siento que la autora se centra mucho en la narración (muy bonita, sí, pero también demasiado ""reflexiva"" para mi gusto) y poco en la profundidad de la trama.
Ya me pasó algo así con su último libro😅

Entiendo las buenas críticas, pero creo que es el momento, para mí, de hacer un parón con esta autora🙈

17933396645246120;"⭐️ BOOK REVIEW ⭐️
📚 A Bookshop Christmas
by Rachel Burton
⭐️⭐️⭐️

Thank you to sagaegmont and netgalley for this audiobook in exchange for an honest review. 

Three years ago Meghan’s husband died from cancer. Since that time, she’s thrown herself into her family’s bookstore as she coped with her grief and guilt. But when famous author Xander Stone comes charging into her life, she realizes that it’s ok to live again. It’s set in a little bookshop in York, England, and filled with a romance-loving book club who are determined to have an authentic Regency Christmas party.

📚 My take:
Whew. Major mixed feelings on this one… There is a lot to love and, um, not love.

♥️ What I loved: All the women in this story are fantastic. Meghan and her mom are wonderful, strong and compassionate. Meghan’s friends helped her find her way in her grief. And even the oldest and feistiest book club member, Trixie, is a force of nature. And the portrayal of Meghan’s grief and healing are superb.

💔 What I didn’t care for: The men in this novel are awful. From Meghan’s irresponsible father who abandoned them in selfishness and still gets a pass, to the snotty little bookstore worker, Colin. 

💔 And our MMC. 😭 Xander starts out so promising! Most grumpy characters find their softness with the FMC, and that started. But then, after thanking Meghan for her trust, Xander irrationally goes insane on her. And while Meghan doesn’t let him get away with his nonsense, she does justify it in her head. “But he already admitted he’s very reactionary.” Red flag! Red flag!

💔 And to make it worse, even though Xander explodes on Meghan when he thinks she’s leaked his secret, when he finds out who actually did it, it’s no big deal. What?!

🤷🏻‍♀️ Ugh. I realize that I have an unpopular opinion on this book, but Meghan and her mom would have been better off ditching the men, reigniting their bookstore with the help of their trusty crew of women and creating their own HEA.

🌲 Q: Do you like seasonal books?

🎃 A: I love them, especially ones that feature autumn and Halloween! But I’ll never say no to a Christmas book either.";2022-08-14 12:27:32+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:31.386727+00:00;39;785;en

17975829604608911;"primaryperfectionist inspired me big time last year with her post addressing this, and I felt compelled to make my own! 💕

Now hear me out. Especially first year teachers… right now is the prime time for thinking you need to go and buy the BEST possible decor pack and deck out your classroom with ~all the things~ from the target dollar spot, and thinking you need to have everything look cutesy and perfect. 😅

I’ve been there. 🙋🏻‍♀️ 

Looking at classrooms on Pinterest and Instagram and thinking mine was “boring” or not “fun” because I didn’t have the latest trend and my bulletin boards were empty. 

But you know what I learned? Your students don’t need this. They need a loving, kind, dedicated teacher who believes in them. Everything else is just stuff. 

And they LOVE creating the space with you. They take more ownership of the classroom when they have a say in it. I promise you. 🫶🏻

There are decor packs that are designed with kids in mind, so this isn’t a dig to folks who work hard designing helpful resources, but please be mindful! Think about the fonts, the colors, and the patterns… it is a big deal when you’re creating a learning environment. Things can be cute and practical! 👏🏻

When you’re setting up your classroom, I want you to think: 

Who is this space for? (primaryperfectionist 🎤💥) and then, how is this space going to complement my teaching and my students’ learning?

17942468251989989;"The throat chakra is a gift that keeps on giving. AND living with an open, AWARE throat chakra is challenging. SPEAKING YOUR TRUTH may sound empowering but it can feel like a curse. Personal truth is not universal & there are times when what is true for you is triggering to another person. The fact that there are many shades of personal truth is a good thing- it creates diversity of thought, talent and perspective. It makes us more successful, adaptive and innovative as a species- but it comes with a lot of friction and tension. Speaking your truth to an echo chamber will not result in the growth that you may gain from sharing your most unpopular opinions.⁣
 ⁣
In my 20s I was a massage therapist/Reiki Master. It was the best job for someone with a sacral imbalance. I got to be the highlight of my clients’ day. Coming to see me provided instant relief & pleasure. All day long people thanked me and sang my praises- it felt so good. I loved my job- yet my growth was stunted in certain directions. It fed my sacral imbalance- my intolerance for discomfort & confrontation. I remained in that unconscious wound of denial- because usually it's when the friction hits the wound that we wake up & start healing. ⁣
 ⁣
In my 30s I went into medicine. I had to deliver diagnoses that people didn't want to hear & suggest treatment protocols that disrupted easy lifestyles. Coming to see me was often confrontational & triggering. Sharing truth in that role required me to create the friction that woke others up to their wounds. It didn’t always result in gratitude & appreciation. It was uncomfortable for me to play that role- but I grew tremendously- as a practitioner & a teacher. I learned how to develop compassion & presence in the face of pain & discomfort. I learned to speak my truth outside of an echo chamber. 
 ⁣
We are all teachers. There are times when a teacher's voice serves to validate through resonance & times when it serves to guide others to find truth through the dissonance of disagreement. All of your voices are essential to this choir- so please don’t abandon your truth when it’s uncomfortable. Keep teaching through the embodiment of your personal truth.";2022-05-10 14:35:44+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:33.331915+00:00;63;3171;en

I'm trying so hard, but I think this might just not be the book for me. 😕 Are there any books being raved about that you weren't interested in?;2023-03-10 02:14:06+00:00;2023-03-27 14:41:34.532387+00:00;5;29;en
17954582558513511;"RUN ON RED // Noelle W. Ihli // 🚨unpopular opinion alert🚨

This book started out so strong! Things that can seemingly happen in real life always creep me out the most. Laura and Olivia are on the way to a college party in the middle of nowhere when they realize they are being aggressively tailed. Literally a worse-nightmare situation that we've all seen on a SVU episode or two. So far, so good, so creepy! 

But that's kind of where the characters start making some pretty dang questionable decisions.  Which okay, they are scared-college students, so I get it.  But as the story unfolds, the plot just seems more and more...fiction.  And that ending... eek. I'll call it television believable and leave it at that. 

This is told from Olivia's perspective which I think works well to really put you in the driver seat of all the action. I really liked having access to her thoughts as she worked out what to do next.  Unfortunately, I think that also made the story a bit repetitive. Even though the book was fairly short, I found myself struggling to get through it at times.  It seemed like at what should have been the height of the book (finding out the antagonist and motive), I was pulling away the most. The motive read a little shock-value and far-fetched; it just really wasn’t for me.  I've seen so many positive reviews though, so I think I am the outlier here!

17948025515370819;"If what the woman took time to explain in her write up is indeed true, that he refused to keep up with the upkeep which she said he only paid child support for 4 months, then she has the right to react the way she does.

Now, why does she react? because he comes up every birthday to post the son and people drag her by calling her names and so on, she in turn will come out to defend herself.

If he choses not to be around the child why should he post him yearly just to let his fans trolls her? If she has denied him access to their son as he claims he would have seek for redress in court since that was where she was granted the custody in the first place.

Alot of men do this and get away with it to give a dog bad name, she constantly coming out to rant now makes her looks toxic where as the man might be silently tormenting her.

Betrayal huts, even if its with a stranger not to talk of someone you know and where once allegedly friend. I am in her shoes and i know how that feels, only those who don't know will pick sides.

A man should not run away from the truth, what has he done to appease her to at least co-parent peacefully without always trying to give her a bad name?

That being said, Tonto should try as much as possible to look the other way round and stop paying attention to all this social media inlaws and judges,.

God has blessed her beyond measures, she has enough to take care of her son so i will focus on just that and being happy if i were her..

It hurts no doubts, but try as much as possible to ignore it and move on, if not for anything for your and Andre's peace of mind..

I wish you all the best.

17978200187062341;"Here’s the thing…⬇️

I know there is some controversy on booksta about whether or not posting bad/negative reviews is ok. And guess what I’m here to tell you? It’s your feed, your reading experience: you do what you want. People have no problem putting  reviews on goodreads or another blog, so I personally don’t see the difference. 

𝗔𝗻𝗱 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗰𝗵 𝗼𝗻 𝗺𝘆 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗱:
1. We won’t always enjoy the same books. That’s fair and honest. 

2. I will not always post the popular opinion. I think we’ve seen that with some of my previous posts. But I’m not trying to hurt you, I’m just giving a different side to something. I’m certainly not the only one who doesn’t like your fave book. 

3. A low review doesn’t mean I’m telling you not to read it. Go read it for yourself. Who knows? You might like it. 

4. If reading things about a book that isn’t automatic praise bothers you, I refer you back to numbers 1 & 2. 

I will not tag an author in a negative review. 

Three star ratings are not bad reviews on my scale (I have a post about this as a story highlight.)

We can still all love reading and not enjoy the same things.

17959044551247000;"“ Agree or disagree? Here’s my thoughts: Every single rep you take matters. Unfortunately I see a lot of athletes who rush through their warm ups as quickly as possible so they can get to their working sets. Understand that EVERY rep, even your warm ups have an effect on your progress, your technique & long term health. 

When you approach each and every rep to perform a perfect repetition, you reinforce the technique you want to perform heavy reps with. This means you’re not just bringing more blood flow to the working muscles but neurologically strengthening the motor pattern (aka technique) of the lift you’re performing. Technique quality under load is also a major factor in maintaining a resilient body & limiting aches/pains that can pop up when lifting. 

Over the years I’ve had the amazing opportunity to speak to many amazing lifters/coaches who all echo the same sentiments: technique matters - every rep. Don’t just “turn it on” when you go heavy but approach every lift to make it look excellent and good things will happen. “

Your girl⁣
🥶 is constantly cold⁣
🩸 has lost her period⁣
🤕 is weak AF in the gym⁣
🤤 is constantly hungry⁣
🍻 and has no social life right now⁣
⁣
All common adaptations and risks involved when you achieve this level of leanness to step on stage⁣
⁣
And because of this.. it’s important to understand that being shredded like this year round isn’t “fitness” nor is it “health”⁣
⁣
🫣 Unpopular opinion coming at you⁣
⁣
Someone with a 6 pack year round is just a person with a 6 pack year round. Not knocking on those who have a year round 6 pack. But to anyone else striving to look like that person posting shredded photos year round, you aren’t striving to be “fit” you are striving to take things to extreme, unhealthy measures to be able to maintain a physique like that year round (key work here: year round)⁣
⁣
To me... this isn’t fitness⁣
⁣
Fitness is (IMO) where you are training towards your goals, being active daily, maintaining a physique that you are confident with AND enjoying your life GUILT FREE⁣
⁣
For some, there’s a time and place for this level leanness. As a bodybuilder, striving for this level of leanness is required, but it’s temporary. Maintaining THIS level of leanness is not sustainable nor HEALTHY⁣
⁣
And the goal after my competition season is to reverse out of this as quickly as possible. I’ll be upping my calories dramatically, intentionally gaining body fat and striving to restore my hormones⁣
⁣
So please…⁣
⁣
Stop correlating fitness with having a 6 pack. There’s more to life than being shredded year round⁣
⁣
Don’t give up all the experiences that bring you happiness for a 6 pack... I promise you that having a 6 pack doesn’t bring you happiness you think it does (trust me), like being present and having fun with your friends and family does⁣

18348663670024651;"✨ Reseña de ""Los seis de Atlas"", de Olivie Blake ✨

Desliza para leer la sinopsis 👉

Lo primero: estoy segura de que esto es una opinión bastante impopular, pero os adelanto que el libro no me ha gustado. ¿Significa eso que a vosotres os puede gustar? Seguramente. 

Yo tenía muchísimas ganas de que me gustara. Es más, era mi libro más anticipado (!!!!) y fui una pesada hasta que lo conseguí. Peeeero.

La magia:

📚 La premisa, la idea, me parecen absolutamente maravillosas. Casi suena a un LJDH versión mágica y dark academia.

Las sombras:

💀 Todo lo demás.

💀 ¿Quiénes son los personajes? No los conozco. Se me dice cómo son, pero se me muestra muy poco /cómo/ son. No he conseguido empatizar con ninguno.

💀 A día de hoy, sigo sin encontrar la trama. Está la /premisa/, pero más allá de eso, ¿qué pasa en sus casi 500 páginas además de nada? El final es apoteósico y eso no lo discuto, pero entre medias he sentido que se alargaba sin sentido.

💀 No me preguntéis por la magia porque no sé cómo funciona. Un personaje empieza teniendo X poder, pero luego tiene otro más, hacen cosas que no comprendo... ¿Y de dónde viene esa magia? ¿Y cómo la desarrollan?

💀 El manejo de los tiempos es digno de estudio.

💀 Las clases eternas sobre física son un sopor, lo siento.

En definitiva, es un libro introductorio más largo que un día sin pan. Que, no obstante, te deja con el escenario perfecto para leer el segundo. Y tengo ganas, que conste, porque me ha suscitado dudas, pero no voy a leerlo ahora mismo. Necesito descansar.

Como digo, esto es solo mi visión. A mucha gente le ha encantado y por algo será, así que eso no os impida darle una oportunidad si os llama la atención.

La gata, por cierto, es Bagheera. Mi hija que vive con pilkunnussita.

En fin, ¿lo habéis leído? ¿Qué os pareció? Me gustaría debatir en los comentarios ☺️ así que os estaré leyendo entre comas ✨

17938274546503177;"Only you can control the content you consume. Not everyone is going to give you a trigger warning. Frankly, not everyone owes us a trigger warning. When I was going through my losses, pregnancy announcements were super triggering. But how could I expect someone to give a trigger warning on their most joyful announcement? I only put a warning on my own pregnancy announcement because I knew a lot of loss moms followed me so I could be easily considerate of my audience. But I truly don't think everyone needs to do that.  Mute, unfollow, and even block became my best friend during that time of my life. 

We cannot expect people to hold off on their joy because of our heartache. And we have the power of our social media in our hands. Unfollow and mute are actually really helpful tools. In the season of being triggered easily by pregnancy-related posts, sometimes I'd see the ultrasound pic and I'd immediately unfollow the person before ever reading their whole post. It's what my heart needed. 

Recently, I made a post in a moms group about really enjoying motherhood and I was accused of triggering moms who felt overwhelmed or who were struggling with PPD or PPA. That was not my intention. But I do think we are allowed to celebrate the joys of motherhood without being accused of triggering someone else. If a post doesn't suit you, keep scrolling. Unfollow...heck block someone if you have to. Trigger warnings can be great for sensitive topics or graphic photos but we cannot expect everyone to trigger warning their joy. I said what I said.

Even though working your butt off day and night and sacrificing your personal time might seem like the way to go, it can actually lead to some pretty negative consequences in both your business and personal life. 

Stuff like burnout, anxiety, depression, and physical health problems can all rear their ugly heads if you're constantly ignoring decompressing and self care. 

Make sure you're taking care of yourself by doing things like setting boundaries, delegating responsibilities, and managing your time wisely. 

Remember, your business growth is dependent on your ability to implement your vision, make decisions, and take action…not on the number of hours you clock each day.

⭐️⭐️⭐️.5

Read this series if you like:
⚔️ Enemies to Lovers
💫 Romantasy
❤️‍🔥 Touch her and die vibes
✨Vampires and Witches
🤍 Easy to follow plot line
📱 Available on Kindle Unlimited

What I loved:
Isolde is such a great character to read along with. She is doing some MAJOR self discovery in a lot of ways after marrying her kingdoms arch enemy - The Blood King. I loved the authors representation of diverse characters (we don’t get this all the time in fantasy reads) Adrian is so so interesting and through the second book we get to learn even more about him. The overall plot and story is good and I am 🤞 for more books as I think it could definitely go somewhere!

What I didn’t love:
The second book LOST ME. A lot. We honestly went in circles with the two MC’s for the majority of the book and when we were finally getting somewhere we are left on a cliff hanger with an “bonus scene” that was so detached from anything that happened in the books🫠 I really love these characters and I want to see what becomes of them, but I definitely struggled with how the second book was written and that threw me for the whole series. I’m hearing we are getting a third book and I will remain hopeful for some redemption! There must be a method to the authors way she wrote the ending of the book (which I’m not knocking, I just want to remain honest with my feelings!)

Here’s a little slide show of different stages of my life. I’ve been an online health and fitness coach for over 7 years but that doesn’t mean I was always “healthy”. I know that some people find transformation photos triggering but hear me out. I find that seeing real people achieve goals to be so freakin inspiring. It was someone else’s progress pic years ago, that caught my eye, got me thinking and called me to take action. 

It didn’t happen over night and it takes WORK but by falling in love with fitness, learning about nutrition and finding ways to make this a lifestyle.. I took control of my life. physically, emotionally and mentally. That’s what I want for every single woman struggling with where to start.

Through trial and error, ups and downs, marriage, divorce, 2 pregnancies + 2 C-sections, deaths in my family… I’ve learned so much about balance, consistency, motivation, mindset and self sabotage. I’ve coached hundreds of women over the years, keeping me accountable and hungry for more education.

18205719391171808;"Ihr Lieben, 
Zu einer Rezension bin ich heute zwar doch nicht gekommen, dank einer spontanen Räum- und Aussortieraktion und anschließendem ungeplantem Schläfchen auf der Couch, aber dennoch wollte ich mich via Post noch bei euch melden.

Wer meine Stories verfolgt, wird schon mitbekommen haben, dass ich in den vergangenen Tagen die Silber-Trilogie von Kerstin Gier gehört habe und meine Meinung zu der Reihe nicht unbedingt konform geht mit der von Vielen von euch. Ich kenne schon viele Bücher der Autorin, vor allem ihre realistischen und sehr amüsanten Romane für Erwachsene haben es mir vor vielen Jahren angetan und ich habe mich immer etwas gesträubt, auch ihre Jugendbücher zu lesen, aus Angst, dort nicht ebenso begeistert zu sein. Nun...bin ich auch nicht.
An sich ist die Grundidee dieser Reihe gar nicht schlecht - Traumwandeln, sofern man einen persönlichen Gegenstand der anderen Person hat - alles bedroht durch die Gefahr eines Dämons. Klingt echt mega und man hätte so unglaublich viel daraus machen können, was mein Herz hätte höher schlagen lassen.
Gefühlt ging es aber hauptsächlich um die Beziehung von Liv und Henry, ihrer Liebe zueinander und (Spoiler) wann sie denn endlich miteinander schlafen werden. Davon war ich einfach maximal genervt #sorrynotsorry und solche Bücher soll ich dann Jugendlichen bei der Arbeit empfehlen? Sehe das leider recht kritisch, aber das ist halt meine #unpopularopinion zu dieser Reihe und ich kann leider den Hype darum nicht nachvollziehen. Aktuell ist meine Lust, auch noch Ihre Edelstein-Trilogie zu lesen, auf dem Nullpunkt angekommen und ich bin mir nicht sicher, ihre Jugendbücher weiter zu verfolgen und doch lieber bei ihren Erwachsenenromanen zu bleiben - denn die haben mir durchweg gefallen.

Wie seht ihr das? Kennt ihr die Reihe? Wie fandet ihr sie? Was ist eure Unpopular Opinion?
Schreibt es mir in die Kommentare ♡

17974518272117421;"Macie czasem ochotę rzucić to wszystko i zatrudnić się jako niania gdzieś na końcu świata, zamiast jechać w Bieszczady? Właśnie taki plan ma główna bohaterka. Zacząć od nowa. W końcu podobno każdy moment jest na to dobry.

Przebrnęłam przez tę książkę dosyć szybko. Skłamałabym mówiąc, że było inaczej. Tylko czy to wystarczający dowód na to, że historia była dobra? Niekoniecznie. Nie była napisana jakoś źle, choć z opisu mogłoby się wydawać, że eeee wiadomo oklepany schemat: nowa opiekunka i tajemnica rodziny u której pracuje. Czytając, miałam flashbacki głównie z Wróć przed zmrokiem, a co dziwniejsze nie tylko wydarzenia, ale także niektóre imiona bohaterów. Teraz nie wiem co sądzić, ponieważ po sprawdzeniu okazało się, że Pod kluczem powstało wcześniej niż Wróć przed zmrokiem. Nie wiem czy to przypadek, czy faktycznie Sager się inspirował w sposób „masz zadanie domowe? Dasz odpisać? – Masz, ale weź coś pozmieniaj, żeby facetka się nie kapnęła”. Trochę rzuca mi to inne światło na obydwie książki. 

Nie mogę sobie poradzić jakoś z tą historią, niby była przyjemna, ale też przepełniona byciem dziwną. To co by stanowiło kropkę nad i to kompletnie zmarnowany potencjał na zakończenie.

18008915290603733;"Sometimes I wonder if I look like a dinosaur walking down the road with my wired earphones in 2023 but I can’t help but see that they serve the exact same function as any wireless ones would

It doesn’t make sense to me to put my perfectly functional earphones to waste and invest in another pair I’d need to charge 

With the technology and marketing in today’s world it’s important I distinguish between what I need, what I genuinely want and what I may want if I place an unnecessary emphasis on people’s perceptions of me 

Ps- I do sometimes use another wireless, semi noise cancelling head set that my mom got gifted but my wired ones are so much more portable AND I can take calls through them without needing an additional accessory

It’s not hard to fall prey to believing we need something when we really don’t. My wired earphones are a true win-win for me

17965338437283593;"Personally, I’m NO one’s puppet. I do NOT appreciate men hosting platforms that attempt to indoctrinate women into being what they want. This is the very complaint many of you have about the “matrix,” yet you’re out here creating your own by projecting your personal beliefs onto society, badgering and belittling women who don’t agree with you.

Not all women want to be “kept,” so when many of you men talk about the women you don’t like, you sound controlling. 

Pursue what you like and leave everyone else alone. Some men don’t mind women with tattoos or a little attitude. There are other men who don’t view the women they love as glorified maids - they see them as an equal partner, yet they understand their role as men. 

Also, the women many of you criticize for this “masculine” energy are exhibiting aggressive behavior because they’ve been traumatized by men and/or stuck in survival mode, so they have a difficult time being soft.

Some women don’t even want to marry or have children, so to harass women with a borage of propaganda on how she should dress, talk, and act, is a violation of First Amendment rights, personal space, personal freedom, beliefs, etc…

Only a woman can teach a woman how to be one. The women who care about the preferences of certain men will seek out what they want to know and turn themselves into those things you want. Plenty of women go out of their way to present themselves to men, that’s your pool. You can pick from the trees that carry the fruit you desire. Just be cautious because a tree sprouted from bad seeds yields rotten fruit…

👾Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow • Gabrielle Zevin
🎮Available Now • aaknopf 

👾I listened to this one on audio and despite all the stellar reviews it just wasn't my favorite. It felt overly long and a little tedious but take that with a grain of salt as this is not my normal genre. I enjoyed the video game aspects of the book and appreciate the tumultuous friendships and how they change over the decades this book spans. I loved Sam's family fiercely. What didn't work for me was stubborn characters, miscommunications, or no communication at all. The 'Pioneer' section was...strange? My favorite character and POV was Marx, Sam and Sadie just frustrated me with their choices over and over again. Fans of books that explore the ups and downs of friendships and relationships that span decades will enjoy this one for sure. 

🎮QOTD• Do you have any strange bookshelf decor? Pictured here is my last fuck. Need to hold onto it. I sent my second to last one to ohiobookgal 😂 Spessa’s End postcard is from novelgrounds

If I was someone who did DNF I would have, but I’m not, so I got through the first one. I’m sure the rest of the series is great (I know so many of you love this) but life is too short and I have too many books I know I’ll enjoy more waiting for me 😂 my journey with this series is over 💔

There was so, so much I didn’t like/believe about this book, but I know it’s a booksta favourite and I know the problem is with me, so let’s not go there.

  Totul mi se pare mult prea lungit, deja începusem să mă plictisesc de personaje și de unele replici care se tot repetau, iar din aceste motive am decis să abandonez seria. Având în vedere câte persoane o apreciază, sper să nu-mi sară nimeni în cap, e opinia mea personală. ☺️

🔴 Do you like reading about dysfunctional families? 
🟠 How about unlikable female protagonists? 
🟡 Do you like when books have funny cat characters?
🟢 Do you think a little romance in a book is nice?
🔵 Agree that emotionally scarred characters are the most interesting?

If you answered 'yes' to any of the above A  Very Typical Family by Sierra Godfrey is the book for you! It follows three siblings who inherit an old house in San Francisco, but in order to actually inherit it they must all be present there at the same time. That's not as easy as it sounds because they haven't spoken in 15 years since Natalie called the police on her older brother and sister and got them arrested and sent to prison. 
Dun dun dun. 

I saw some reviews saying they didn't think the main character was likeable or that the family was typical at all and honestly, DUHHHH. Sometimes books are a little cheeky and I like that. If you want a straightforward story maybe stick to more basic authors🤷🏻‍♀️

A Court of Thorns and Roses Series 🥀🦇✨
Author: Sarah J. Mass
Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 4/5

The chokehold this series has on me 😩😍🫠
(At least the beginning of it) Hear me out…

A Court of Thorns and Roses (5⭐️)
- The heavy focus on worldbuilding and Feyre’s background provided a great foundation. I quickly became HOOKED!
- Loved the strong female lead and felt a connection to Feyre.
- Liked Tamlin but LOVED Rhysand. There’s just something about a dark haired ~villain~ and I found myself secretly rooting for Rhysand the moment he and Feyre met!

A Court of Mist and Fury (5⭐️)
- I felt like I had separation anxiety from this book when I wasn’t reading it!
- I think the magic really came alive in this book. I want to live in Velaris!
- When I tell you my jaw DROPPED at the end of this book…
- Not only is this my favorite book in the series, but it is one of my favorite books of all time and I will NEVER get over it.

A Court of Wings and Ruin (4⭐️)
- Appalled by Nesta’s audacity.
- Took awhile to get through, but I still really enjoyed it!

A Court of Frost and Starlight (4⭐️)
- Still couldn’t stand Nesta.
- Shortest book in the series with happy and lighthearted moments. Not much happened, but it was nice seeing the characters more relaxed.

A Court of Silver Flames (3⭐️)
- It’s safe to say I hated Nesta the entire series. She only became tolerable at the end of this book.
- This book felt uneventful and there is no reason why it should be as long as it is. I almost feel like I wasted my time reading it, but it was nice to see things play out. HOWEVER, I feel like I still have unanswered questions!!?!

Do 👏🏼 not 👏🏼 walk 👏🏼 … RUN. (At least to the first and second book) I think the series went downhill after the first two books, but I was too invested to stop reading.

I did enjoy this series and recommend it. The element of surprise throughout this series left me wanting more, so don’t let the page length of these books deter you from reading them. If you space the books out it won’t feel like a marathon.

I know I have somewhat of an unpopular opinion about this series. What were your thoughts?!";2023-02-11 13:38:15+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:35.368403+00:00;40;0;en

18005177599615299;"Really Good Actually by Monica Heisey

Well, I didn’t love it. It started out with some clever observations, self deprecating humour, and I had high hopes. Maggie is getting a divorce and is not handling it well, at first I found her spiralling thoughts entertaining, but I quickly started to just feel horrible for this poor girl who clearly needs help. It was around page 100 when I first wondered if this book was going anywhere. Spoiler - not really. I get that she was supposed to be a mess (I did look at the cover), but I was hoping for a sarcastic, clever character and Maggie just didn’t click with me. I started to dread hearing more of her thoughts - but for some reason I stuck with it hoping she’d redeem herself.

Although I did feel for Maggie and thought I liked her in the beginning, I ended up relating more to her friends in their complete annoyance and exhaustion. Maggie is a mess for 300 pages, it was too much. 

Finally the last 50 pages she seemed to start to get her life together, kind of. 

Is this one on your radar? I’m super curious what other people think about it, maybe I just didn’t get it.

18034132663438735;"🎧From the other side…

Many of you love this book, and reviews tend to say the same things: 

🌊You fell in love with these characters.
🌊You were surprised that, even though you’re not a gamer, you really enjoy reading about that world.
🌊 This felt very different from other things you’ve read.

The flip side/ an opposite perspective: 

As I read this, I kept thinking that people who like Sally Rooney will likely love this book. I hate Sally Rooney books. Sure, the characters are real, flawed people (flipside of that is they’re not people I would want to spend time with at all, so why would I want to read about them?) I couldn’t take them for long. 

I had to force myself to keep listening to this one, and I know I’m not the only one. I just couldn’t make myself care about any of this. I made a valiant effort, because I know how much so many of you enjoyed it. But for those of you who plan on reading this, know that you are not deficient if you don’t care about any of the gaming stuff or find it boring. I did. 

I’m also going to put this out there– I listen to a lot of audiobooks, and I have for 17 years. This is one of the poorest audiobook performances I’ve ever listened to. The narrator paused midsentence and at the end of every sentence, to the point I had to speed it up to 1.8 X for my brain not to shut off (I usually listen at 1.4x). Her voice was grating, and no one softened the mic, so her consonants hurt my ears. I made sure just to listen to it in the car, because earbuds would have been impossible. For such a huge book, I was shocked.

This is the scene of the first taco that I actually loved. We went to Sonoratown when in LA, and I loved their taco de Cabeza special of the day so much that I went back twice to get more. The cucumber Agua Fresca was delightful as well. I loved this place, and look forward to trying the tacos in Mexico City when we are there in April.

Are you a taco fan? What’s your favorite kind? 

What are your weekend plans? Other than the symphony, I’m not doing much other than getting my roots covered up 😂.

⚠️ unpopular opinion time ⚠️

i didn’t love this book. 

there, i said it - i got it out the way immediately 😅 

i’m going to try to keep this post as spoiler free as i can whilst also explaining why i didn’t like it as much as i was expecting too! 

my main issue with the book was that it felt rushed towards the end, as if so many loose ends were just crammed into the last 100 pages to be dealt with and it ultimately felt disappointing and a bit clunky 🤷🏻‍♀️

there were some plot points that i’m still not sure i understand the relevance of - monique and the coffee table for example? 

i also think that it would’ve been good for the reader to see monique’s article about the right to choose in death in order for other elements of the book to have quite the impact that TJR clearly intended 😅

my other issue is that there were parts where it felt as if some aspects of LGBTQ+ history were glossed over or just shoehorned in when relevant in terms of the timeline not the plot and so on which felt a bit disappointing when i’d heard so much about how queer experiences were important in the novel 

did i enjoy it on the whole? yes, absolutely! 

is it my favourite TJR novel? definitely not 

what do you guys think? do you agree? or have i totally missed something that would’ve made me love it? 🤔

18000645433559338;"📖REVIEW📖 
The Bear and the Nightingale 
Genre: Fantasy inspired by Russian folklore 
Rating: 3/5

THE SIP🥤:
Vasya lives deep in the isolated Northern Russian woods. She has the ability to speak to the woodland spirits and befriends them. But some righteous community members, spurred on by the fervor of a new priest, are ridding the community of the old traditions and beliefs. Vasya must work to save the ancient spirits before a worse fate befalls them all. 

THE SPILL 🫗:
Here I go again. Behold: another unpopular opinion.

While the setting descriptions were beautiful (perfect for a midwinter read) and the writing itself was lyrical, neither were enough to keep me engaged in the story. I found it to be too slow and atmospheric. Almost nothing happens in the first half except backstory and scenery descriptions, quickly becoming redundant. The fantasy world was never fleshed out enough to make me feel transported to another place. Unfortunately this novel didn’t give me what I want from my fantasy reads:  an adventure within a new world. Instead of enchanted, I was mostly bored 🤷‍♀️

Anyone make it through the trilogy and favor the other books better?  Does the pace and adventure pick up in the subsequent books?

17921200070674705;"I'm glad Circus did the demo for Xia Yu Yao, the tuning's superb and Xia Yu Yao is of insane quality. But the song is very... lackluster? Nondescript?  Some of the lyrics were questionable, especially ""I'll lace up my shoes, prepare for the worst//Under a sky of blue, I charge through the dirt"" it didn't exactly fit the song, it sounds like it'll fit in a separate, different song. The song's structure is very predictable, there's no oomph to it. In a sea of Circus's songs, this is that one song I can't recall; it's not memorable. I love Circus, and some songs like Enough, Wrong + Right, Misery Loves Company, and What Goes Around goes past my expectations. Butterfly doesn't. It sounds good, but not special.

18253469422179957;"This is an unpopular opinion on this book. I was really looking forward to reading this book. A woman who decides to take a chance at interning to see what options she might have missed out on.

Unfortunately, I had a hard time connecting with the author and her choices. This story takes place mostly during the first year of the pandemic. It felt like while the rest of us were trying to figure out what was going on, the author was unhappy she was having to fly home sooner than expected.

I know that my having lost someone very close to me during the pandemic is what colored my view of this story. I learned some things about art and Broadway from her writing. Mostly though, I just wondered given the state of the world at the time, and all of the unknowns, how was okay with what she was doing.

As others have stated, I expected this story to pick up and it just never did. I admire anyone who is willing to put themselves and their story out there for public consumption. This is honestly a case of the book just not being for me.

17947788452526542;"📚REVIEW📚 Sorry in advance, but this one really didn’t live up to expectations! I know that Bookstagram LOVES this book, so let me explain: 

For a book that isn’t even 300 pages, the repetition was just SO frustrating and unnecessary. I felt like I read everything that happened in this story twice. First, while it was happening, and then again as part of an inner monologue or an admission. I just kept reading the plot points over and over, and I couldn’t help but feel that it was wasted space in a book that could have used a lot more depth. Ultimately, I got bored…

I know this is a work of fiction, so I won’t harp on the fact that some parts were totally unrealistic, but there were also a lot of things that felt too “convenient,” which always comes off as lazy writing in my opinion 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

I initially thought I could see the reveal from a mile away, so the twist at the end was semi-redeeming (I won’t reveal why it was only semi-redeeming to avoid spoilers, but if you’ve read the book, you can probably catch my drift…).

I might be the only person in the Bookstaverse to have not loved this book, but who doesn’t enjoy a good unpopular opinion from time to time, right?!

❓ What was your favorite holiday read this year?

❗ I shared my full 2023 holiday releases favorites, and the top one on that is still my fave, You’re a Mean One, Matthew Prince.

Contemporary Holiday Romance
Pub day: November 2021
First person present tense, single POV

Unpopular opinion time!
I had very high hopes for this one, but in the end, it was pretty meh for me. What saved it from being less ⭐ was the LI and the side characters. 

👍
+ I loved Luka! He’s the love interest and he’s basically a saint. Great book boyfriend, so thoughtful, nice, loving… He was probably my favorite character.
+ The spice and tension are very well written as well. Even without getting Luka’s POV, you can really feel their yearning for one another. 
+ The setting (both the farm and the small town), the vibes, the other townsfolk were all adorable. 
+ I liked the side characters enough that even though I didn’t love this book, I might be tempted to read the rest of the series. I knew even before looking it up who the other two couples would be for the next two books, and I’m interested in seeing their chemistry develop. 

👎
- I didn’t like the main character AT ALL. I couldn’t stand how wide-eyed naive and clueless she is. Her business keeps being vandalized and sabotaged, and she has basically just thrown her hands up. I feel like one quote sums her up perfectly, from her perspective: “I knew something was wrong with the damn thing and I didn’t think twice about it.” and that’s her, all the time, she doesn’t think twice about anything. But the most unbearable is that even after seeing tons of evidence to the contrary, including it being spelled out for her loud and clear, she just can’t ever fathom Luka liking her, going as far as self-sabotaging. I’m not against people being clueless about other people’s feelings towards them, but this was really extreme, and unbelievable.
- The other plot points weren’t interesting enough in the first half of the book to sustain interest while waiting for something to happen with the romance. Basically nothing happens in the first 45% of the book. I was pretty bored and close to DNF’ing.

⭐️⭐️

Out today! But…

Errrmmmm .. unpopular opinion coming in hot! 

I went into this one totally blind. The cover looks creepy, the title sounds intense, it’s listed as a thriller.  That was more than enough to sell me. I read the synopsis AFTER I finished reading the book and I am just left shaking my head. If you read the synopsis along with only chapter 1 , done , you basically have read the whole story. By only reading the synopsis and chapter 1, you know who the killer is, you know what happened to the teenagers, leaving absolutely no mystery throughout the story, no plot twists, nothing. 

I hate to say this but I was beyond bored. The story is more of a detective investigation where nothing is shocking ... because again, we already solved the case in chapter 1 as the reader… 😑

Also there was just so many eye-roll moments … picture this … you are in a small town , a girl gets kidnapped and she is a type 1 insulin dependent diabetic … obviously this girl is going to run out of insulin … so what does the kidnapper do ? Well he just walks in to the pharmacy of course and gets himself some insulin from the pharmacist . 😑 wouldn’t you be a TAD suspicious about this grungy, sweaty, nervous man coming in and asking for insulin and will pay with credit card when it’s literally posted on every block and in the news that A GIRL WHO IS INSULIN DEPENDENT IS MISSING. And since when can you get insulin over the counter with no prescription? Especially in a small town… pull up that customers file .. hey .. you don’t take insulin …smh. After that I just wanted to start skimming. Was totally over it. 

I could go on and on about this one, but I think I’ve written enough. Blegh. I don’t recommend. 5 stars for chapter one. 2 stars for the book itself as a whole.

Thanks to Sourcebooks Publishing for providing me with an E-Book advanced copy in exchange for an honest (in this case , brutally honest, review) 😅

18020478877436370;"The Summer I Turned Pretty by Jenny Han

⭐️2/5⭐️

Finished Reading: 2022/09/17

- Romance
- Childhood Friends
- Flashbacks
- Summer Holiday

Let's get to the point, I didn't like this book.
I read this because it's kind of a booksta classic and I saw many shining reviews about this book.

The Summer I Turned Pretty (TSITP) is not the kind of book I would enjoy reading. This book didn't really have a plot and it was more focussed on flashbacks than making progress in the current romance happening. 

When one of my friends described the book being a ""flashback-romance"" novel, I thought it would be like Addie Larue, where we have flashbacks as well as moments in the current timeline. The flashbacks in Addie Larue helped me understand the characters and the plot better. TSITP didn't really do much with the flashbacks though. If anything, those flashbacks made me hate the person Belly (Female MC) ends up with in the end.

I also didn't really like the female MC. I get that she's supposed to be like, the little sister who always gets left out. But she sounds like a pick me girl 😑
I find that the way she processes thoughts in her mind is a bit childish, honestly. At the beginning, I thought she might undergo some character development, but that never happened either...

I think the book only got interesting once the flashbacks started recurring less in the book. But that's like...30 percent of the whole novel(?)

I didn't enjoy this book, but I know most other people did. This is just my opinion, and you can totally DM me and start a conversation about review, just don't be mean 😌

We went to the hospital. 🏥 how was it paid for? I didn’t really know or care to be honest, it didn’t even occur to me at the time 🤯🫣 

Fast forward to now and health care is one of the TOP expenses a family incurs. It’s so sad 😭 people often think “ Marketplace Plans” are the best / ONLY option but then get slapped with a giant deductible they can never meet 😅🥹 

So. If you need real insurance, that actually doesn’t smack you with a giant deductible the second you show up at the doctors.. give me a call. We can explore real options that suit you better.

✖️ I found the narrative really - odd - we have all these POVs and none in first person - I felt disconnected from the story ⁣

17974227664662832;"Get ready, I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion post…some people are gonna hate me but I didn’t like this book, it just wasn’t for me. 

Here’s why, the main character fell flat, I didn’t get the way she acted and her reactions didn’t resonate with me at all. 

The twist, was not believable. I just couldn’t get behind it. This was far above suspending belief for me. With no real build up to that type of twist, be it historical or through a character it didn’t make sense. 

I didn’t DNF it, so there’s that, it is very readable albeit frustrating. If you enjoy popcorn thrillers this is definitely the book for you, I know many loved it. It just missed the mark for me. I have loved many Sager books in the past and will probably read the next, but this one left a bit to be desired in my humble opinion. I rated it 3 stars because it’s readable, there is a mystery, and a satisfying yet strange resolution. 

I’m feeling a bit off today and it’s a rainy stormy night so I plan to curl up and read til I doze off! How are you spending this Friday night? What are you reading?

While the idea of selling yourself or your business idea in the short amount of time it takes to ride an elevator, is often seen as a quick and easy way to get your message across, it actually creates pressure to condense a complex idea into a few seconds leading to oversimplification.

Propunerea acestuia sună cam așa: ceva la schimb (el hotărăște ce) pentru o zi de viață în plus. 

Ce idee ingenioasă, am zis când am citit despre ce e cartea. Japonezii ăștia vin mereu cu ceva nou pentru public. Dar…(pentru că există un dar), povestea oferită nu a fost nicidecum ceea ce mă așteptam. 

O fi romanul de față descris ca unul emoționant, însă ideea mai sus prezentată, care vine la pachet cu super așteptări, nu a fost exploatată la maximum. 

Genki Kawamura scrie precum un copil. Inserează pe ici pe colo dialoguri fade, lipsite de vreo emoție. Pe tot parcursul lecturii m-am gândit că le-a scris doar de dragul de a umple paginile. Romanul putea fi foarte bine rezumat la o scrută poveste pentru adulți și cred că avea mai mare efect. Fără detalii care nu își au rostul.

De altfel, dacă citiți sinopsisul, acesta e plin de spoilere. În mai puțin de 10 rânduri îți este pusă la dispoziție aproape toată acțiunea cărții. Și titlurile capitolelor sunt spoilere. “Dacă x ar dispărea din lume” e genul de titlul care răpește din bucuria și curiozitatea de a vedea care va fi următorul lucru care s-ar putea să dispară. 

Aș mai descrie-o și ca fiind foarte previzibilă. Nu a mai fost nevoie nici să aflu dacă va alege sau nu eroul nostru ca pisicile să dispară. Știam deja răspunsul. 

Păcat de ideea frumoasă care stă la baza acestei cărți. Dacă era preluată de cine trebuie, rezultatul ar fi lăsat cu gura căscată. Așa, am primit în schimb o povestea care, din punctul meu de vedere, e de citit doar dacă nu mai ai cărți prin bibliotecă sau timp extrem, dar extrem se limitat pentru citit. În altă ordine de idei, nu a fost pe placul meu și nici nu o recomand, decât dacă țineți morțiș să vedeți care-i treaba cu ea.

2⭐️. Este și prima carte din 2023 care m-a dezamăgit profund. Cred că dacă citeam ficțiune la ordinea zilei, nici atât nu i-aș fi dat.

#unpopularopinion

Skończyłam już wszystkie trzy i poprostu muszę o tym opowiedzieć...

Siadając do trylogii Okrutnego Księcia miałam duże oczekiwania. Chciałam, żeby ta historia mnie oczarowała. Naprawdę tego chciałam.... 
Ale niestety już pierwszy tom mocno sprowadził mnie na ziemię i pokazał, że popularność danego tytułu nie ma nic wspólnego z fajną treścią. 

Bohaterowie fatalni. Jude to najgorsza postać kobieca jaką poznałam. Jedyne na czym jej zależało to władza, a ulubionym zajęciem było szukanie sposobów żeby przy tej władzy zostać. Niezdolna do uczuć, nieszczera w słowach. Nie zliczę ile razy czytając książkę zbierała we mnie złość na jej poczynania. 
Cardan to takie 5/10... Czasami zabawny, a zazwyczaj to głupi i arogancki. Nie było między nimi chemii, więc nie rozumiem tej wielkiej miłości na koniec 🤷‍♀️ skąd się wzięła?

Świat wykreowany, świat tych elfów, ich zasady, knowania, mówienie ciągle naokoło, ci są po naszej stronie, a zaraz jednak nie są, bo ktoś krzywo popatrzył... No jakoś tak bez ładu to wszystko było.

Czasami faktycznie jakiś plot twist ratował sytuacje i rzeczywiście można się było na chwile wciągnąć. 

Nie przekonało mnie w tej historii nic. Zupełnie nie moja bajka. Trzecią część męczyłam chyba prawie dwa tygodnie. Cieszę się, że to już za mną i mogę wrócić do książek, które są bardziej 'moje'.

Oczywiście biorę pod uwagę, że treść książki skierowana jest do młodszych czytelników, ale takie książki też czytam i niektóre serie towarzyszą mi do tej pory (Wojownicy, Zwiadowcy, Harry Potter), ale ta całkowicie mnie wynudziła i na pewno będzie szukała nawego właściciela.

Happy Friday, friends! It’s another mini book review since this is the January pick for a book club I’m in🤗. I won’t post my full review here, but you can find it on Storygraph and Goodreads (link in bio). 

It’s really hard to share my feelings on this one in a way that doesn’t involve spoilers. Let’s just say that this book is almost a carbon copy of a book I read in 2019. If it weren’t for that, this would probably have been a 5-star read for me. 🙈 I gave it three stars because I liked the ending to this one better than the other book. I think I will pick up the next installment though, since I feel like it will have to have more original content.

I think I’d only recommend this one if you haven’t read the other book. (I feel like it could be a spoiler, so DM me if you’d like to know what the other book is☺️.)

„Grudzień drugich szans” anna.langner_ niegrzeczneksiazki czytamzlegimi

Ta historia sama w sobie się broni - przyjaciele z dzieciństwa, których drogi się rozeszły, spotykają się w dorosłym życiu. Za karę służbowo jadą do Zakopanego i spędzają tam święta. Zimowy klimat pierwsza klasa.

Ot, kolejna świąteczno-zimowa książka. Tylko, że takich książek na polskim rynku co roku jest całe mnóstwo. Duża konkurencja rodzi wymagania wobec kolejnej nowości. A przyglądając się bliżej „Grudniowi drugich szans” już nie jest tak super. 

Ta historia nie jest szczera. Za to jest płytka. Mam wrażenie, jakby wrzucono do niej kilka chodliwych tematów - niemarnowanie jedzenia, choroba dziecka, próba gwałtu - zamieszano i podano, nie doprawiając. A totalnym przegięciem jest tłumaczenie kradzieży kleptomanią. Nie mając na to schorzenie żadnych dowodów. „Kwiatki” redakcyjne dolewają tylko oliwy do ognia.

Maleficent is my favorite Disney villain by a landslide so I was stoked to read this Twisted tale, but I quickly realized it wasn’t going to be what I was hoping for. For being a YA read this was very confusing. There were two timelines going on and I wasn’t quite sure which is which (doesn’t really matter because neither were very good). I wanted more Maleficent and less everything else, and that’s just not what I got from this one unfortunately. I’ll continue on with the series eventually, but I need s little break after this train wreck. ⁣

17965533203091624;"📚LOS RENGLONES TORCIDOS DE DIOS📚

▪️Los renglones torcidos de Dios, 1979
▪️Autor: Torcuato Luca de Tena
▪️Editorial: australeditorial
▪️448 páginas 

Alice Gould llega a un psiquiátrico con la intención de investigar un crimen, haciéndose pasar por una paciente. Eso es lo que ella dice, pero toda esta historia bien podría ser un delirio imaginado por una mente enferma. A lo largo de todo el libro, el autor juega con esta idea, de tal forma que al final no sabremos si Alice está enferma, si está realmente investigando un crimen o si ha sido víctima de un plan de su marido para encerrarla. 

La sinopsis es muy prometedora. Y entiendo que con semejante premisa, muchos lectores hayan caído rendidos ante esta historia. De hecho, llegué a esta lectura con la idea de que era un libro maravilloso, incluso el libro preferido de muchos. 

Así que aquí voy a ir con cuidado e intentar expresarme de forma sincera y respetuosa. Para mí, este libro fue una decepción de principio a fin. Por supuesto, entiendo la época en que fue escrito y la que refleja, que no fue la más brillante ni de ideas más modernas en España. De hecho, investigando en internet, me he dado cuenta de las verdaderas atrocidades que se cometían en los psiquiátricos todavía en los años 70 en España. Aún así, no estoy segura de que el autor haya reflejado tan fielmente esta realidad (pienso sobre todo en dos mujeres a las que describe y que si lo habéis leído sabréis a qué me refiero, me cuesta creer que algo así existiera). Luca de Tena confesó que pasó un tiempo internado en un psiquiátrico para documentarse, pero no sé hasta qué punto fue como un paciente cualquiera o si tenía una posición privilegiada, ya que pertenecía a una clase alta y reconocida en la España franquista. Esto también se transmite a través de algunas de las cosas que dice, que es otro tema que me ha disgustado de la novela. Por no hablar de la protagonista, que me ha parecido odiosa, y de la fascinación que ejerce sobre todos los demás (aunque esto podría ser debido a su propia percepción y a un delirio de grandeza…). Y por último, la forma tan antigua en que está escrito me ha sacado de la lectura. 

¿Lo habéis leído? ¿Qué opináis?";2022-12-07 17:31:40+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:37.305863+00:00;60;341;es

Fans of the raven cycle please don’t hate me!! 

I finally read this series last year. Many fans of all for the game also love this series. Plus I wanted to know why everyone loves Ronan and Adam so much. 

But to be honest I felt that this series was very overhyped. I didn’t hate it but I didn’t love it. Half the time I had no clue what was going on. I struggled to finish each book. The only reason I finished the entire series was because I was holding out hope for Ronan and Adam. But when the final book came around and they finally got together, I was let down. I expected so much from them but got like 2 or 3 kisses. Was not enough. Maybe all the hype comes from the fanfiction. I don’t know. 

I will say that Ronan was my favorite part of the series. I wanted more of him. And even though I didn’t get as much of Ronan and Adam as I anticipated, I do like them and I definitely would have loved to see more of them. 

Did I love the series like i had thought i would? No. Do i think it’s overhyped? Yes. Am I glad I finally read this series? Kinda. Haha

Side note. I initially tried to listen to the audiobooks because I knew that would be an easier and faster way for me to read them but 5 seconds into the audio I had to call it quits because I could not listen to a narrator who sounds so much like Donald trump read to me. NO THANK YOU!!! 

QOTD: what book/series do you think is overhyped?

📖 Daisy Darker
✒️ Alice Feeney 
⭐⭐⭐

The picture that almost wasn't. Swipe for outtakes. 😂

I have seen so many awesome reviews for this #book so I was excited to join #saturdaybookstaclub to read & discuss this one. For perspective, I liked Rock Paper Scissors by the same author which received pretty mixed reviews.

🌊Daisy Darker & her family are summoned to her Nana's estate at Seaglass to celebrate Nana's 80th birthday. Daisy, her older sisters, Rose & Lily, niece Trixie, and childhood friend Conor arrive at Seaglass prepared to fulfill the request for their matriarch. 

🌊After a celebratory dinner & the revelation of Nana's will, the mostly aggrieved family members turn in for the night to wait for the tide to go out so they can depart. At midnight, Nana is found dead, possibly murdered. An ominous poem is written on the wall & the dysfunctional family begins to consider who among them is responsible for Nana's death. 

🌊I appreciate the nod to Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None. I typically enjoy locked-room thrillers. Unfortunately, this book bored me to tears. I am a character driven reader & this was definitely a plot driven book. While I felt bad for Daisy because of the wretched way her family treated her, I could not connect with her at all. The ending saved this one from being a total bust but I'm not sure that it was really worth the effort 

🌊I loved the ominous poems used to reveal the true nature of the characters. The use of family videos to provide backstory was a pleasant change from the usual flashbacks. Ultimately, I found this book very slow & underwhelming. Less a thriller & more a very drawn out #whodunnit.

QOTD: Do you typically like retellings of classic novels?

I’m so behind on reviews and I’ve just accepted it. Here’s a little quick catch up. These 3 weren’t it for me to be honest. They weren’t horrible but not favs. 

ᴄᴏɴꜰᴇꜱꜱ

I’m not a fan of the insta-love and that happened here. I also didn’t understand the reasoning behind huge plot lines. So it didn’t make sense to me. 

ᴅᴇᴀᴅ ᴡɪɴᴅ

Having loved the first two books i was excited for this one. I was excited to learn more about Bram but he was just glossed over i felt like. This is a slower paced book that i think was meant to tie up loose ends. I think there could have been more suspense to it. And it ended too quickly.

ᴛʜᴇ ᴘʀɪꜱᴏɴᴇʀ

This book gave me a lot of Behind Closed Doors vibes. I was liking it and curious where it was going but then some where towards the end it just fizzled out. I felt like it wasn’t totally surprising and just felt like, why?

❔Do you post reviews for books you didn’t love?❔

I love an honest review whether it was loved or not. Sometimes it validates my feelings and let’s me know I’m not alone in those thoughts or it lets me know if that readers issues, will be issues for me or if i would still enjoy it either way. Helps me decide.

📚 Book Review📚: The Golden Spoon by Jesse Maxwell
📅 Pub Date: 3.7.23
🌟 TL;DR Review: Mixed Thoughts

I was excited to read a thriller baking competition mashup, but unfortunately it fell a bit flat for me. There was a lot of internal thought and I would have liked more show vs tell. I liked the baking bits but could have done with less of them. While it was fairly predictable, I enjoyed seeing how the mystery eventually unraveled. This is a cozy mystery but the mystery doesn’t kick in until the last 20%. It was an interesting idea but the execution didn’t fully work for me. 

Thanks to atriabooks  simon.audio for the ARC/ALC.

📚 Book Review📚: The Angel Maker by Alex North
📅 Pub Date: 2.28.23
🌟 TL;DR Review: Not for me

I had a really hard time with this one. I felt like I was grasping to remember who was who and what was going on for the whole book. I had both the audio and physical copies and I struggled to follow along with either version. The ending was very ambiguous and underwhelming. I’ve seen great reviews for this book, but for me it was overly complicated, confusing and frustrating to read. 

Thanks celadonbooks and macmillan.audio for the gifted ARC/ALC.

📚 Book Review📚: A Likely Story by Leigh McMullan Abramson
📅 Pub Date: 3.14.23 
🌟 TL;DR Review: Mixed Thoughts

I had really mixed feelings about this, and while it wasn’t the best fit for me I did like the idea of the story. I disliked both of the MCs and wasn’t rooting for either one. I thought the writing style was easy to read and well written, but there were some scenes that I felt should have been edited out. The book within a book was interesting, but it also contributed to the slower pace. There were a few things that didn’t click for me with this, but I think fans of a literary fiction slow burn character driven story will enjoy this.

Carrie Soto is Back by Taylor Jenkins Reid 🎾
Genre: Historical Fiction
Pages: 384
Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️

I told you this was a week of reviews! I am clearing my review pile and this is my THIRD review of the week 👏🏼👏🏼

If you saw my story when I finished this, I’m not excited to share this review…because I know it’s a very unpopular opinion!

I’ll save you all from a synopsis since this book is everywhere right now and I’m sure most of you know what it’s about!

To start…this is my first TJR that I didn’t love 😬 this was one my most highly anticipated reads of the year and I’m so sad it fell flat for me.

WHAT I LIKED: 

Carrie is a BADASS woman. I LOVE reading characters like her, and we need more of her. I also LOVED her relationship with Javier and seeing that growth. That was truly beautiful. I’m a sucker for father-daughter bonds in books and I loved their complicated relationship.

WHAT I DIDN’T LOVE:

This book is truly all tennis. There is nothing. But. Tennis. I am not a sports gal, I was a theater nerd in high school, so watching/reading about sports has never been my thing, and I probably should’ve realized that going in.

With that being said I was really hoping for more. I wanted more depth from Carrie and the supporting characters. I would’ve loved to learn even more about her background and culture. I wanted scenes that weren’t on the tennis court or talking about tennis. 

Unfortunately, this is my least favorite TJR 😔 if you’ve read this, what did you think?";2022-09-15 14:44:36+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:39.067406+00:00;26;391;en

Immediately following on from the events of It ends with us, lily and atlas navigate their lives as they come back together. 

Did I think IEWU needed a sequel? No. And honestly I had no real intention of reading it. But I’m glad I did. It was actually really nice to get some closure on the story, and there were a lot of things covered I wasn’t expecting. There is enough recapping that it’s okay I had a big gap between book one and two, but a few details I had forgotten. 

I’m going to start by saying I’m pro it ends with us. It is NOT a romance book and should not be interpreted as one. I think CH did a good job writing about gaslighting, love bombing and all the other typical symptoms of abusive relationships. As a follow on, it starts with us did a good job of analysing how it’s not over, just because the relationship ends. The abuse, control, manipulation can continue in other ways. It’s always ‘why don’t they just leave’ without much consideration for these things, and it’s important to shed a light on these issues. So unpopular opinion or not I stand by it. 

Secondly, I adored the relationship between atlas and his brother. At first I found it a bit predictable, but the fact it looked at breaking patterns of abuse within families. Wow. I was quite taken aback and this icy heart definitely melted a little 😭

Overall, I found the first half a bit boring, the repeated journal entries a bit unnecessary, but what captured me was the different ways relationships and families were discussed and by the end found I really enjoyed reading this sequel. 

Let me know if you have read it and what did you think!

Guess who finally finished both of these Sarah J Maas books 🤭

And unpopular opinion I was a bit disappointed 🙈

These are the first Sarah J Maas books I read, and I think I was overhyped by Booktok and Bookstagram.

Don’t get me wrong: I liked the story line and I love Hunt and Ruhn but that’s about it. I think the books could be a lot shorter and still have the story work.

I really wanted to like this book, but I found it boring for the majority of the pages.  I knew going in that the story was inspired by JFK Jr's life, except, instead of an ""inspired by"" novel, this one felt more like a mediocre retelling, with some very bad taste changes.⁠

⭐️⭐️⭐️.5

Read this book if you like:
✨beautiful writing
✨a different/creative storyline
✨a FMC who is constantly learning about herself
✨art/history

What I loved:
This is definitely some of the most creative, beautiful writing I have read. I really enjoyed our characters Addie, Henry, and Luke. I feel the author did a great job of aligning the past and present to tell Addie’s story. I also enjoyed the historical accuracy/art the author included throughout! Overall I would recommend this book to others and enjoyed it for the most part. 

What I didn’t love:
Honestly, I think this book has a bit more hype than is warranted. But maybe I’ve been too into romance lately 🤣 I felt like this book was a slow burn through the ENTIRE story. Which was hard for me because I didn’t catch myself really grabbing for it/dying to read it. I felt we needed more of a full circle moment at the end, and it felt flat/predictable for me. I think if I went into it recognizing how slow of a burn this story would be I may have enjoyed it more! I know people are obsessed with this story, and I think is beautiful, just not one I became OBSESSED with. 

Did this book live up to the hype for you?! And who’s joining us for a new read in Anxious Girls Book Club next month?!

17880636953761010;"✎ La Recensina: quando la copertina è meglio della trama. Ecco la mia unpopular opinion.

Valore: ☆☆☆

Beh, proprio malaccio questo libro non è.
Qualche settimana fa, quando Neri Pozza ha cominciato a fare qualche spoiler per l'uscita di questa saga — che conta di sei uscite, una ogni due settimane, dal 17 gennaio fino ad aprile — mostrando, un poco per volta in una foto là e un video lì, le magnifiche copertine di questa edizione è riuscita a creare un hype pazzesco, che ci siamo scapicollate ad acquistare ""La piena"", scritta da Michael McDowell.

Ed ecco i miei due cent, unpopular leggendo le prime recensioni delle mie colleghe: la trama non è all'altezza della bellezza della copertina! Cioè, intendiamoci subito, il libro si fa leggere. C'è quel pizzico di magia, incantesimo, mistero che aleggia su tutte le prime duecento pagine e questo fa sì che, vi dico già, la lettura continuerà perché la curiosità di vedere se quello che ho capito è la verità è forte. Quindi, tranquillə, potete acquistare questa saga, soprattutto se amate il paranormale e l'horror.

Cosa non mi è piaciuto molto?
L'aver passato tre quarti di libro a leggere la madre del protagonista odiare a morte e mettere i bastoni tra le ruote in ogni modo possibile ad una dei protagonisti del romanzo, cosa che mi ha sfiancato prima della metà del libro. Poi una certa indolenza nel raccontare questa storia che comunque, a mio parere, ha un non so che di interessante. Magari è solo il primo libro, magari è una lunga introduzione, sta di fatto che mi sono un po' annoiata.

Ripeto: andrò avanti, solo con gli ebook, a leggere questa saga perché ora sono curiosa e si sa, la curiosità è la leva più potente quando non si ha altro a cui attaccarsi per continuare a fare qualcosa.

Vi saprò dire.

Ps: siamo a Perdido, nel profondo sud degli Stati Uniti, dove dopo che una piena ha distrutto quasi tutto il paese, appare dal niente una ragazza dai capelli rossi che nessuno conosce, senza passato e che crea un certo scompiglio in una delle famiglie più importanti del paese.";2023-02-14 14:00:11+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:39.082918+00:00;7;0;it
17970455591152436;"Sometimes it feels like I read about it everywhere: “If you want to be rich, you need to build passive income streams” or “Make Extra Money Without Sacrificing Your Time with These 25 Passive Income Apps” or “23 Passive Income Ideas To Help You Make Money In 2023” 😑🤦
.
Of course, the idea sounds nice: Have income, without doing almost anything or sacrificing any time. I get that, and would love to have such a stream. 🙃
.
But in my opinion, the general idea of passive income is rather bogus than something one should really believe in. Why? Because almost no income is build/received passively (besides maybe inheriting money) and one has done *some* work in order to receive it. 🧑‍🏭
.
May it be investing in stocks and receiving dividends, or building an online advertising/affiliate business, or building an social media profile and receiving an income for brand messages, etc. - for each of these examples, *some* significant work has been done in the past to build an income stream, and - even worse - for most of these examples, one needs to spend time to maintain the “passive” income stream.
.
Still, of course it’s great to have an income, which requires less work or “minimal” work, and I love that idea, since everyone tries to be most efficient with their energy - but calling it “passive” is a bit extreme and untrue in most cases.
.
I’m sure you get the idea and I’m definitely not the first one pointing it out, but I feel like it’s not being raised often enough and the story about “passive” income is being told way too often 😉🥱
.
Do you feel the same? Or do you like the term “passive income” and it motivates you to build such a stream?

Habe nur ich den Eindruck, dass Frauen im Liebesroman oft ziemlich schlecht davon kommen?
Gerade in letzter Zeit fällt  mir immer öfter auf, dass die weibliche Hauptfigur regelrecht in ein gewisses Schema gepresst wird.
Zickig, tollpatitschig, schüchtern, kann mit Kritik überhaupt nicht umgehen und hat meistens  kein Selbstbewusstsein. Sie ist verdammt schön, sieht das aber selbst nicht..
In dem Buch welches ich aktuell lese (ich sage keinen Namen) wirkt die Hauptfigur in der etsten Hälfte gar nicht so, aber zur Mitte hin erwähnt die Autorin die Unsicherheit der Hauptperson fast krampfhaft in jedem zweiten Satz.

Natürlich ist das nicht in jedem Buch so und auch nicht immer unpassend. Aber manchmal fällt mir einfach auf, dass ziemlich viele Klischees zusammenkommen. 

Mir stellt sich die Frage woher das kommt. Kommen solche Figuren besser an? Gefällt es der breiten Masse besser, wenn der Mann haushoch überlegen ist und die unsichere Frau aus der Reserve lockt? Oder sehe ich das einfach zu kritisch, oder habe im Moment kein gutes Händchen für Bücher? 😬

In meinem aktuellen Projekt lehne ich mich aus dem Fenster und habe genau das Gegenteil erschaffen. Eine starke weibliche Persönlichkeit, die das ganze Buch über kein einziges mal in jemanden hinein stolpert. Die erfolgreich, hübsch und unsympathisch ist - und das alles auch weiß 😋

Ich würde mich freuen, wenn ihr eure ehrliche Meinung teilt. Sind euch solche Eigenschaften auch schon aufgefallen bzw. habt ihr sie negativ aufgefasst, oder sehe ich das zu kritisch? Was ärgert euch in Büchern? ❤️

•
For someone who has run an Instagram account predicated on the basis of posting book reviews for the past 3.5 years, there’s certainly been a lack of reviews on my page these days.
•
Maybe it’s laziness, maybe it’s intimidation bc there are so many people who can write transcendent reviews that I can never come close to - but I’ve been thinking that maybe it’s a lot more than that.
•
The larger the number of people who follow this account (which will never ever ever not blow my mind) - I feel a responsibility to fairly & accurately represent the things I’m reading, but to also remember that real human beings spent months and sometimes years putting words onto paper.
•
Who am I to call someone else’s work, their pride, their art, “trash” or that it was “terrible”? Call it growing up or whatever you will, but if I’m going to have people reading my opinions then I want to make sure that I’m not adding to the amount of vitriol already floating around on the internet.
•
I know that #unpopularopinion can be fun to indulge in, but I think I’m going to be turning over a new leaf and only doing my best to amplify the things that bring me JOY or open my eyes.

So the first book I finished reading this year really disappointed me. And for those who know me, I never shy away from giving a bad review, so if you love this book, continue reading at your own risk.

Initially, I wanted to give this one 3 stars because maaaaaybe an introverted person with anxiety like myself just failed to relate to the author's colourful lifestyle. But after having thought it over, I decided to give this one a 2.5 star rating. 

First of all, the title is a clickbait. This book should have probably been called ‘everything I know about being single and having friends’. Even though I love reading about female friendships, writing a book about love and finishing it with ""the only love I know is with my girl friends"" is kind of a cop-out if you ask me.

The random emails and recipes are boring and I would just skip them. The first few chapters were great, but then the story began to drag. Perhaps I'm just not a fan of books about an over-privileged, white middle-class woman whining about the things that only people in her social bracket would understand. I would say reading this book is like listening to other people's inside jokes and ""you should have been there"" stories. I have read so many memoirs, but only with this one did I fail to sympathise.

Another thing I hate is how narcissistic the author sounds throughout this entire book. She repeatedly refers to men and the partners of her female friends as though they were nothing more than toys and sources of distraction that stand in the way of her friendships. She is open about how selfishly and violently bitter she felt when her closest friend Farly got engaged, which a truly good friend would never be able to relate to. And so what I thought was going to be an emotionally impactful read ended up being a forgettable and bland book in actuality.

QOTD: What are the dealbreakers for you when reading a book?

17950150646528224;"TOMORROW, AND TOMORROW, AND TOMORROW by Gabrielle Zevin
⠀
2.5 stars 🌟🌟
⠀
🚨🫡DEEPLY UNPOPULAR OPINION ALERT
⠀
No one crucify me - I know this book is extremely beloved far beyond the corners of bookstagram, and I know it has touched thousands and thousands of readers. I will never not respect that, and I’ve unsurprisingly spoken to very few people* who didn’t like it.
⠀
*literally one person
⠀
I also feel like I’m late to the game reading it, which means my expectations might have been too high. I’ll keep my review short and, while not sweet, hopefully not too brutal.
⠀
It was vivid enough, but not anywhere near as sweeping or consuming as I expected it to be. I felt like the characters invited me into their story, but once I arrived, it became clear they weren’t serious about their invitation and wished I hadn’t showed up.
⠀
Reading this book felt like walking into sliding glass door I didn’t realize was there. I felt like I could clearly see everything I wanted to experience firsthand beyond the door - substance, the truth of the story, something meaningful and perhaps even perspective altering - but every time I thought, “Wow, I’m excited to go outside,” I’d take a step forward and slam into the glass, getting a resounding headache from the reverberations of the impact echoing around my skull. 
⠀
I can’t put my finger on the source of the disconnect. The story felt forced to me, or like the author was trying too hard. I’m excited I finished, and that’s the last thing I’m say.
⠀
I’ll end on a lighter note to say I’m excited about The Last Russian Doll, which has been super captivating thus far!

It’s fundamentally false. 🚫

You can create money without money. Granted it’s harder… but it’s possible. 

If you don’t have money and you want more of it, you’ll need to rely on either TIME or KNOWLEDGE.

Carve out free time to dedicate to learning or creating. Learn how to do something or do something. 

If you don’t have time, make it! 

How many hours of ‘screen time’ did you have this week? 📵

Go to bed 1 hour earlier and wake up one hour earlier. 

STOP making excuses. 🛑

Educate yourself for FREE with YouTube or podcasts on how to invest or make money whilst you’re driving, walking or doing the dishes. 

If you’re still struggling with time, utilise your KNOWLEDGE to earn more money at work, as a freelancer on the side or monetise what you know through consulting, coaching or creating content. 

When you create more money use it to buy back your time (far more valuable) and create more value and money. 

Yes, making money IS easier when you have money but let’s not fool ourselves into thinking it’s the only resource we have. 

What do you think? 🤷‍♂️

•
“All families have their own version of normal, and I confess that ours is a little different from most.”
•
🚨 Warning: unpopular opinion alert!! 🚨
This book begins in a promising way by showcasing the darknesses inside Seaglass and the members of the Darker family. There’s something a bit creepy about a house on a private island that can only be reached when the tide is out… The tension continues but honestly, I was so bored! Book of the Month labeled this as a thriller, but I would say it is more of a slow burn mystery. If that’s not a thing, it is now. Daisy Darker is essentially a rip-off / mixture of When We Were Liars by E. Lockhart (which I also did not enjoy) and the film Knives Out. F for originality. Would not recommend, although I must admit that Feeney has a way with words and I gathered up a lot of quotes. 
•
“People rarely need the things they think they need in order to be happy.”
•
“The reason why someone is lying is almost always more interesting than the lie itself.“
•
“It has always fascinated me, how people seem to know so little about how their bodies work. But maybe that’s because their bodies do work, and it is human nature to take things that aren’t broken for granted. I lost count of all the people I had to explain my heart condition to during that stay. Over and over, I had to teach grown adults how their hearts worked and clarify why mine didn’t. People seem to know more about how their phones function than their own bodies.”

I read this ARC in October and, while I didn’t love it, I picked it for BOTM so that I could get A Fire Endless as an add-on lols. The things we do for books 😂

Let’s get to the review: I had hoped this would be as good as A Flicker in the Dark (to which I gave 5 stars) but sadly it didn’t do it for me 😕

I felt it was trying to do too much at once, like with the podcast angle. I wanted it to play a bigger role in the story (à la The Night Swim), but ultimately it didn’t add that much.

I continue to like Willingham’s writing a lot and was intrigued by the premise, but they just didn’t come together in the end to wow me 🤷🏼‍♀️

18000846799655718;"Book Review • House of Earth and Blood by Sarah J. Maas

Rating • ⭐️⭐️

Premise • After two brutal murders, half-human, half-fae Bryce and fallen angel Hunt, fight to unravel the mystery. The threads they tug ripple through the city’s underbelly, across warring continents, and down to the deepest levels of Hel, where things that have been sleeping for millennia are beginning to stir…

My opinion:
Pros
• diverse characters 

Cons
• too long
• eye-rolling sexual references 

I know that this in an unpopular review of this book, but I just thought it was meh.  Definitely not worth the amount of time you have to put in to read the big chunk of a book.

17945073004876979;"So recently we’ve got our first sekai concert which was cute but I honestly think that the sekai characters should stay in sekai. I think they should stay exclusively in the games. It’s not even because I don’t like the characters but I really think that Crypton does not need 10+ more characters to promote and to try to treat equally. I mean they can’t even treat the vocaloid equally. I know that the Sekai characters are very popular and that’s great but I really don’t think that crypton should try to expand them and promote them more. when they don’t know how to promote the other Vocaloids that aren’t miku. I mean so far we only got a concert but it’s not too unreasonable to think that crypton is probably going to promote and push the sekai characters outside of the games.

Admin thoughts: Fair points but as long as they still seperate them enough from the Piapro characters I don't see a problem with it. Like the Cup Noodle collab was the thing I needed without knowing before

Title: The Maid
Author: Nita Prose
Rating: 3/5 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️
•
Unpopular Opinion time…. I mean it’s only really an unpopular opinion because I feel like I am the first person to not give this book a 5 star rating, however, I did like it - I just didn’t LOVE it. I think there was so much hype surrounding this book that I just really got myself super hyped and felt a bit letdown.
•
This was a super quick, easy cozy mystery with one of the most unique characters I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. I truly loved Molly the Maid and the simplicity of her life but within the first 20% of the book, I knew exactly where the story was headed. Nothing about this story was overly shocking to me, though I did enjoy reading everything that happened. I did enjoy the twist that was thrown in there at the end.
•
I get it, cozy mysteries aren’t always super shocking, and I dont need them to be, but I would rather not be able to figure out most of the story so quickly in. Would I read more stories about Molly the Maid and her friends? Absolutely, without a doubt. Again, this isn’t a bad review, I enjoyed this book, I just didn’t love it like everyone else seemed to. Would I recommend it? Sure, if you like to read a cozy mystery with a very unique character.

It’s okay to DNF (Did Not Finish). #OK2DNF

Last night I quit a top-rated and critically-acclaimed book because of a combination of foreboding and forewarning. It was cringing at every page turn, afraid of impending doom/dismay/disaster/darkness/dog trauma. I was dreading the read. I knew it was a great book, but it wouldn’t work for me.  So I cut myself a break.

Trust your gut and be kind to yourself as a reader. Ask yourself: Is the juice worth the squeeze? If yes, read on! If not, move on.

Archer’s Voice by Mia Sheridan
Rating: 3.5 ♥ (rounded up to 4 on GR)

A super hyped bookstadarling that didn’t live up to the hype for me. I think I’ve seen only positive reviews for this one so I guess this is an unpopular opinion!

I loved the storyline so much! Two broken souls coming together; Bree who was running from demons of her past and Archer who kept everyone at a distance and didn’t speak to anyone. They meet and everything changes for both of them. 

While I loved the storyline, there was something missing and the ending felt super rushed. It has one of those endings that in two pages everything magically comes together from outrageous realities. It seemed very unrealistic to me and it didn’t have to be that way. Lastly, the romance just fell flat for me; it needed more than what we were given and just ended up not being enough for me.

This book takes place in the 1990s in a town called Shaker Heights, a place known as the establishment of ideal citizens living ideal lives. The plot surrounds two families from two different socioeconomic backgrounds and delves into the relationships that take place between both households. 

I don’t want to give too much away because I personally like being surprised when I read books, but I will say that if you like reads similar to “Big Little Lies” by Liane Moriarty or “Ask Again, Yes” by Mary Beth Keane, then you would probably like this. Also, look into an in-depth synopsis because there are some triggering events.

Would I read it again? This might be an unpopular answer…Eh, probably not. It wasn’t terrible! I liked it well enough. For me, it’s isn’t re-readable because of some of the content.

BITE SIZE REVIEW

I was MIA because I was busy finishing to listen to BABEL by RF Kuang.

And that book gave me very conflicted feelings.

🍂I found it slow in the beginning, a little bit boring then some parts went faster and were truly fascinating;

🍂I love languages and loved discovering more about it yet the many match pair in Chinese were sometimes a little too much;

🍂I could see that Robin was taken from his homeland and that he was abused, forced to fall into a mold, never seen as British and exploited yet I never really fell into his shoes to the point of living his life. There was always like a distance between him and me.

🍂 The historical element even if amended by the magical element of silver was very well done yet some inconsistencies grated me the wrong way. Yet I knew it was fiction so the author was entitled to take liberties with history.

🍂I was equally enthralled yet bored at times.

🍂I didn't want it to end but switched to wanting to have a peek at the ending.

As you can see, it's a complex book, with an exceptionally beautiful writing, broaching heavy topics like racisme, strikes, oppression, colonialism, exploitation on a magical backdrop that evoked many conflicted feelings for me.

🎧 AUDIOBOOK REVIEW 🎧 
Greenwich Park 
by Katherine Faulkner
🌟 🌟/5

I am being a bit generous when I give this one 2 stars. I listened to it on audio and that was even flat.

One could never guess what was going on because it was all over the place. Told in 3 pov and 2 weren't necessary at all.

When Helen meets a friend at her pregnancy class she starts getting weird feelings from her new friend Rachel. Then Rachel wants to move in. Rachel also drinks and smokes it up while pregnant. Another thing completely unnecessary to the story line.

When Rachel goes missing after a tiff with Helen it turns into a mystery. Where is Rachel?

There's a sister in law pov which is totally irrelevant and then a friend who was at least somewhat appropriate to be heard but not much.

The ending, the reasoning behind the whole story? I was so excited to read this and well SPLAT.

18356683867017340;"Non mi piace Jane Austen

😕 Il mese scorso ho letto ""Emma"" insieme al mio #gdlsmeraldo ed è stata una vera tortura. Dopo averlo finito mi sono chiesta se Jane Austen faccia per me oppure no. Anche perché nemmeno ""Orgoglio e Pregiudizio"" mi ha fatta impazzire (sicuramente meglio di ""Emma"" eh, ma niente di eccezionale).

🤷🏻‍♀️ Ho provato a leggere le trame degli altri libri della Austen e mi sembrano tutte simili, in qualche modo, a ""Orgoglio e Pregiudizio"". Forse avrebbe dovuto scrivere solo quello.
Insomma, la mia unpopular opinion è che Jane Austen sia molto sopravvalutata, soprattutto rispetto ad altri scrittori e scrittrici del suo tempo.
🫣 Ecco, l'ho detto.

🥱 Ma parliamo di ""Emma"", che in una sola parola potrei definire noioso. Il tema centrale è il fraintendimento in amore. Emma, padrona della casa in cui vive col padre, si trova, dopo il matrimonio della sorella, a gestire il piccolo mondo che le ruota attorno.
La nostra protagonista si presenta subito come una giovane donna estremamente presuntuosa e super detestabile, quasi quanto il padre (un ipocondriaco che si lamenta continuamente). 
Emma accoglie in casa Henriette Smith, più giovane di lei, cercando di maritarla adeguatamente, ma finisce per creare solo casini. 

😮‍💨 Unico personaggio non detestabile è Knightley, fratello maggiore del cognato di Emma, l'unico capace di dirle la verità e di farle notare i suoi difetti.
Ma non basta a risollevare la trama super dilatata e prevedibile. 

👂🏻 A un certo punto ho deciso di ascoltarlo su Audible perché non ce la facevo più a leggerlo. Se non fosse stato per il gdl, lo avrei mollato. Anche perché poteva decisamente essere più breve.

👎🏻 Per una volta, quindi, un libro che non vi consiglio di leggere (non è piaciuto a nessuno nel gdl, nemmeno a chi di solito adora Jane Austen).

17953877204377162;"A Court of Silver Flames

QOTD: If you read a Court of Silver Flames, do you think the series got better? What series did you read where each book was better than the last?

It took me some time to finish A Court of Silver Flames and while I may be in the minority here, the only aspect of this book that I really enjoyed was the ending. I would have loved to see this be a lot shorter despite the emotional growth that takes place with Nesta. There were so many wonderful parts to the book that lost its impact by other parts of the book… like the gawd damn stairs, seriously was it that necessary? Could we have not seen some writing technique here where we understand the significance without having to read her “Mount Everest” story?! If ever I wished for a “fade to black” it would be for all the parts containing the stairs! 
Again, I know it’s just me and I am one of few that did not enjoy Nesta’s process of overcoming her grief.
This all being said, I’m so happy I finished the book and I love all the fan art I’ve collected for this series. There will always be a special place in my heart for books 1 and 2.
To end this on a good note, Nesta and Cassian are fire!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶

𝙃𝙚𝙧𝙚 𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙢𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙪𝙜𝙝𝙩𝙨: This may come as a shocker but this is only the 2nd book I’ve ever read where I share the unpopular book opinion. It took 161 pages before the story really took off for me. I’m not sure if perhaps I reached my YA quota as I recently binge watched The Summer I Turned Pretty and just felt as though it was slightly similar with the one girl two brothers theme. 

I don’t want to give away any spoilers but I totally figured out what Percy’s big secret/betrayal was during the truth or dare scene. I knew it! Totally called that one. AND Percy, girl read a room! She spills the big “secret” to Sam on one of the worst days of his life and then a year later on another day Sam and his brother Charlie were dreading she decides to make a grand gesture to Sam. She has the worst timing if you ask me. I was so frustrated with her and Sam’s lack of communication- that lasted for 12 years! No wonder Charlie was angry and always scowling during Percy’s visit. At least we weren’t left with many unanswered questions by the end.

⬆ (I 100% choose this quote  because it reminded me of Legally Blonde )

Honestly, the only reason I'm even writing a review for this book is because I took this picture before reading the book, which I try to do in case I accidentally ruin the book while I'm reading it, and I really liked the picture. So here I am writing a review for it just so I can post the picture 😂

This book for me was just okay, it wasn't terrible but it also wasn't great. I found I was bored throughout it and even though there was a twist at the end that I didn't see coming it still couldn't save the book for me. None of the main characters were overly likable, in the flash backs they were all teens at camp & one of the girls were overly sexualized (& written by a male author, which just gives me the ick) also, there was no logic behind this story, I know it's a thriller and you don't always need logic but I feel like you need at least a little bit of a believability factor, which this book was big time lacking.

I do seem to be in the minority when I was checking out other reviews on GoodReads, so if you're into Summer camp psychological thrillers with lots of secrets and a twist at the end that I'm almost positive that you won't see coming, this one might be worth checking out for you.

I actually made a tbr for October, which a rarely do, and this book as well as two other Riley Sager books were on it and unfortunately this was the only Sager book that I finished. 

Do you normally make a monthly tbr? If so did you knock many off if your list last month?

Vor mehr als zweihundert Jahren lebte in dem kleinen Dorf Stellata in der Lombardei ein Mann von schwerem Gemüt, ein Einzelgänger und Träumer, der dachte, mit seinen Erfindungen großen Ruhm erlangen zu können. Doch immer wieder scheiterte Giacomo Casadio, wurde zum Gespött des Dorfes. Als er auf dem alljährlichen Dorffest einer der seit mehreren Monaten am Fluss lebenden zigaras begegnete, einer jungen Schönheit mit langem, schwarzem Haar und von biegsamer Gestalt, war es um ihn geschehen. Er war hingezogen und gleichzeitig eingeschüchtert von ihrer Grazie, doch die Frau bestand darauf, ihm aus der Hand zu lesen: Und sie sah in den Linien, dass er der Mann ist, auf den sie jahrelang wartete. Wenige Monate später heirateten Viollca und Giacomo entgegen dem Willen ihrer beider Familien; eine Ehe, die von Beginn an unter keinem guten Stern stand - und deren Nachkommen Generation um Generation immer wieder mit Herausforderungen zu kämpfen haben werden. Sie sind einerseits Traumtänzer, nicht ganz am Boden und der Wirklichkeit behaftet, andererseits strebsame und kluge Köpfe, unglücklich verliebte, arme wie wohlhabende Menschen. Und doch besteht die größte Aufgabe darin, weder den Kopf in den Wolken zu verlieren noch in den Fluten unterzugehen.

Voller Magie begleitet Daniela Raimondi in ihrem Debütroman ""An den Ufern der Stellata"" (OT: La casa sull'argine. La saga della famiglia Casadio, aus dem Italienischen von Judith Schwaab) die Geschichte der Familie Casadio, die ihren Anfang im 19. Jahrhundert findet.

I wanted to love this book so badly! Historical fiction and sci-fi are my favorite genres, and the marriage of the two really appealed to me! I do believe a good editing could have made this book a lot stronger, but I personally found it to be poorly-paced and disorganized. There is a mention fairly early in the book that the narrator has known her love interest for almost 4 years. By her training timeline and descriptions, I'd have guessed that 6 months or a year had passed at most.
•
Another example is how multiple exciting chapters lead up to an expedition to the Cretaceous. Once the crew had landed, however, there were only a few paragraphs about the first moments of the mission and then, with no transition at all, you are told it's Day 74 of the mission...and the narrator is waking up to sexual assault by her colleague who, by all accounts up to that point, had been a perfectly fine, if not slightly arrogant, friend and confidant to the narrator? It felt so contrived. 
•
TL/DR: I was personally put off by the author's sudden inclusion (and flippant handling) of pregnancy loss and acts of sexual violence. The premise was SO promising, but the writing itself left much to be desired. I didn't enjoy this book enough to commit to reading the sequels, and it's not one I'd recommend to others. This one gets ⭐️⭐️ Looking forward to April, cheers!

Purtroppo le Jardin Majorelle hanno deluso le nostre aspettative. 
Abbiamo trovato il posto molto turistico, sopravvalutato e con un costo del biglietto un po’ al di sopra della media delle attrazioni di Marrakech. 

Abbiamo sentito parlare di questo posto come idilliaco.

Al suo interno ci sono piante molto rare, soprattutto grasse, cactus, 🌵aloe, banani,
ninfee, 🪷 un colore blu che caratterizza ogni area del giardino ma purtroppo nulla di più. 

Un consiglio personale che ci sentiamo di darvi è quello di dedicare il vostro tempo ad altre attrazioni della città.

Avete mai provato questa sensazione?

Agnieszka on 17-aastane, lihtsa puuraiduri tütar, kes elab perega orus, mida piirab tume ja sünge mets. Aga see pole mingi tavaline mets, vaid Mets, kus peitub kirjeldamatu kurjus ning paljud hädaohud. Orgu kaitseb Metsa eest aga üksikus lossitornis elav Lohe, kes pole tegelikult lohe, vaid hoopis 100-aastane võlur. Iga 10 aasta järel valib Lohe orust omale 17-aastase neiu, kelle endaga koos oma torni elama viib. Kuigi kõik märgid viitavad sellele, et valimise aastal langeb liisk Agnieszka parimale sõbratarile Kasiale, siis tegelikult otsustab Lohe siiski enda teenijaks valida hoopis Agnieszka. Koos Lohega elades avastab neiu ka endal teatud võimed ja koos peavad nad hakkama välja juurima Metsa kurjust.

Oeh…siin raamatus oli minu jaoks kõike liiga palju, mul kippus mõte pidevalt kuskile uitama minema, lõputuna näivad kirjeldused olustikust ja sündmustest ei suutnud mind üldse köita. Ja siis ilmselt juhtuski nii, et mingitel hetkedel ma lasin lihtsalt silmad tekstist üle, ei süvenenud ja siis hiljem ei saanud enam aru, miks üks või teine asi oli juhtunud. Ja mul on kadunud igasugune tolerants selliste armusuhete osas, kus naine on napilt täisealine (kui sedagi) ja meespool siis iidvana (antud loos 100-aastane). Saan ju aru, et see puhas fantaasia, aga milleks seda üldse vaja on…ilma selle armuseigata oleks teose lõpplahendus ikka sama olnud, vähemalt minu arust 🙄.

Tõsi - see pole tegelikult päris üks ühele sellesse teemasse sobituv raamat, aga samas on autor ka ise öelnud, et ta on palju inspiratsiooni saanud erinevatest muinasjuttudest ja folkloorist. Näiteks on siin mainitud slaavi muinasjuttudest tuttavat Baba-Jagat jne. Et ma siiski loodan, et mu pingutus selle raamatu lõpetamiseks oli seda väärt ja lugemisväljakutse teema saab täidetud 🤭

🌸 Dustin Thao
🌸 Literatura młodzieżowa

🌸 Co w środku?
Julie przeprowadza się do Ellensburga, niewielkiego miasteczka w stanie Waszyngton. Poznaje tam Sama, z którym zaczyna ją łączyć wyjątkowa więź. Związek Julie i Sama zostaje zerwany wraz z tragiczną śmiercią chłopaka. Ale czy na pewno? Julie w przypływie rozpaczy dzwoni na komórkę Sama, która powinna odpowiedzieć jedynie głuchym sygnałem. Jednak chłopak odbiera. Jak to możliwe? Jak długo i jak często mogą trwać te nadnaturalne rozmowy? I czy Julie będzie w stanie pożegnać się z Samem raz na zawsze? 

🌸 Jakie wrażenia?
,,Z tej strony Sam” to dla mnie niestety rozczarowanie. Uważam, że ta powieść jest w bardzo wielu miejscach nielogiczna. Dlaczego Julie nie została objęta opieką psychologa po śmierci Sama? Dlaczego Sam po wypadku miał siłę aby przejść półtora kilometra, ale nie wpadł na pomysł, by zadzwonić po pomoc? Co z drugim kierowcą, który też brał udział w kolizji? 

Nie umiałam również polubić postaci Julie, która jeszcze przed śmiercią Sama była dość ponura i negatywnie nastawiona do większości rzeczy (chociaż może miał to być trop grumpy & sunshine?). Nie poczułam również chemii między bohaterami. Miałam wrażenie, że smutek w tej książce czuję jedynie w związku z samym wydarzeniem, jakim jest śmierć młodego człowieka, a nie w związku ze współczuciem dla rozłąki Sama i Julie. Ich relacja po prostu nie przekonała mnie do siebie. Mimo to podobał mi się sposób ukazywania wspomnień Julie. Przedstawione były bardzo onirycznie, płynnie, z ciekawymi przejściami.

🌸 A jakie jest Wasze ostatnie książkowe rozczarowanie? 🌸

I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but friends to lovers is my least favorite trope. 

As I was reflecting on books that I haven't been feeling as of late, friends to lovers has been a common theme.  Many times, it feels like there's a high level of pining which goes on and on OR one of the characters is too wishy-washy with their attraction. 

I will still read a friends to lover book, in fact these stacked books are ones I absolutely love, but it's definitely not a trope I will actively seek out. 

What do you think?  What tropes do you not love?  Tell me!

***
Przykro mi, ale totalnie odbiłam się od ""Lat"" Annie Ernaux. Podeszłam do tej historii z entuzjazmem, który w połowie książki kompletnie wyparował. Męczyłam się z nią, a nawet chciałam porzucić... Dobrnęłam do końca, choć nie twierdzę, że było łatwo. Końcowe strony okazały się lepsze, ale to pewnie kwestia poruszenia czasów, które są dla mnie bliższe. 

Książka przepełniona jest chaosem i zawiera mnóstwo politycznych i historycznych wynurzeń, które nie ukrywam - zupełnie mnie nie interesowały. Taką historię w polskim wydaniu chłonęłabym jak gąbkę, ale francuskie przeżycia są dla mnie zbyt odległe, abym w jakikolwiek sposób mogła się z nimi utożsamić. Być może wychodzi ze mnie ignorantka, bo w zasadzie mogłam spodziewać się takich fragmentów, sięgając po twórczość Francuzki, ale wyobrażałam sobie, iż będzie tu więcej kwestii dotyczących życia Ernaux, a te jednak nie wysunęły się tu na pierwszy plan. Kolejnym minusem jest dla mnie pisanie w pierwszej osobie liczby mnogiej - do mnie ta książka trafiłaby bardziej, gdyby autorka nie próbowała przemawiać za swoje pokolenie, ale tylko za siebie. W moim odczuciu ta wersja jest na tyle bezosobowa, że nie wywiera żadnych emocji.

Żałuję, że powieść noblistki rozczarowała mnie, a nie zachwyciła, ale doceniam ją, bo jest napisana dobrze - po prostu prawdopodobnie problem tkwi we mnie, gdyż oczekiwałam czegoś zupełnie innego. Na pewno sięgnę po Bliskich, bo wydaje mi się, iż tam będzie więcej emocji i osobistych refleksji autorki, a na tym mi zależy. ""Lata"" mają dobre momenty i chwilami zachwycają, więc jeśli Francja jest wam bliższa niż mi, to polecam sięgnąć, bo pewnie bardziej do was trafi.

Thanks so much blackstonepublishing for this advanced copy! I had to read it immediately! I have enjoyed this authors books previously so i fully expected to love this one as well. But if I’m fully honest, this one didn’t work for me. 

I felt like the first half was a weird romance. With a side of “suspense” but it wasn’t really suspenseful to me. It was definitely a slow burn. But i felt too slow. And then towards the end it finally started to pick up but it took an odd turn. It wasn’t what i expected but i thought it was so far out of left field that i didn’t love the twist. 

This one wasn’t for me. 😰 i really wanted to love it. But i just didn’t. I have seen many who did… so give it a chance if you’re feeling it.  Having loved the authors other books, I’ll definitely be looking forward to her next book but not every book is for every reader. And that’s ok!

I'm worried for upcoming vocaproducers who likes to do the same or similar style as Creep P, if there are any. And the vocaloid community should be more open minded to more genres outside of pop and EDM too (since popular songs are saturated in them, plus grunge rock).

Agree or Disagree? Write down in the comments

Admin thoughts: I have to disagree about the only Western producer who's outside of the niche part. We have ippo.tsk who does rock, Aphelia and Ensou who do metal, Patchwork-P has some electroswing songs etc. In fact Creep-P's older songs follow pretty much the formular for alternative industrial music

Maybe it got better.. maybe not. I’ll never know. Because after 3 weeks of sitting on this one, reading a chapter, ignoring it completely… i said fuck it.

Who has time to waste anymore? No one! Time is precious. And no one gets a golden ticket for completion. Soooo why bother??? 

I don’t typically allow 3 weeks anymore but… everyone said it was great. I thought maybe I’m in a slump. Maybe it gets better. 

There was nothing inherently bad with this book, i was just bored. Not enough was happening. I thought the MC was kinda dumb. She left her phone in her room too many times. It wasn’t scary enough. Blah blah. Just bored. It’s fine. Moving on. Onto the next!!!

Unfortunately, this one just wasn’t it for me. It started off strong with Abbie and her friends declaring war on her manipulative and slimy ex, Richard, but then the story got repetitive. I wanted more character development for Abbie and Damien, but instead of learning about the two of them, we got a hundred stories of why Richard is the worst (yes, we get it already!) I wanted more revenge and less reminiscing 😂

I should have listened to kell.of.a.read on this one. (You should check out her review!)

This book is getting a lot of love right now, so take my review with a grain of salt. Maybe it just wasn’t the right time for me. 

I got a lot of 𝘔𝘦𝘢𝘯 𝘎𝘪𝘳𝘭𝘴 and 𝘓𝘦𝘨𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 𝘉𝘭𝘰𝘯𝘥𝘦 vibes from this book, so if you love those movies this might be a good one for you!

17897514416576756;"💭 What do you do with books you didn’t love or won’t read again?

I was unexpectedly approved for a netgalley ARC of You’re Invited and finished it before my bookofthemonth order arrived, so buyer’s remorse is real 🥲😂 

I loved the author’s debut novel My Sweet Girl (5🌟) but a winner this was not. 

What I liked:
👩🏾 Flawed protagonist
🇱🇰 Learning about Sri Lankan culture
💰 A glimpse into the lavish lives of upper-class society
🇸🇬 Mentions of Singapore
💪🏻 Feminist themes
👯‍♀️ Complicated female friendships
🏠 Family drama and dynamics

Unfortunately as a thriller, this flopped for me. There's zero suspense and tension as hardly anything happens for the bulk of this slow-moving book. I was hoping for an explosive revelation that would wow me, but nope. Instead, too much is crammed in the last few chapters just like in My Sweet Girl.

I also found this terribly predictable because not only are wedding thrillers becoming dime a dozen, but it's the same old formula all over again. Been there, read that.

LAS 27 CITAS DE CHARLOTTE MAY de Abril Camino

Una novela de 380 páginas catálogada como comedia romántica. 

Conoceremos a Charlotte una mujer que durante una comida familiar ve como su hermana pequeña tiene una familia perfecta y siente la necesidad de encontrar lo que tiene ella. Enamorarse de una vez para siempre

Con esa idea se planta en su casa en la que vive con Moon y Oliver, sus mejores amigos, y se la hace saber por lo que crean una lista para el candidato perfecto.

Para sorpresa de nadie, no sigas leyendo estas frases si no quieres spoilearte, ⛔️describen a Oliver... ⛔️

Puedes seguir leyendo.

Va a empezar a presentarse a citas que según nos dice la autora han pasado en la vida real y yo pienso.... ¡la leche! Como dice ella, la realidad a veces supera la ficción. Van a haber un total de 27 citas y durante estas citas la realidad de su hermana, de sus amigos, de su trabajo....

No he conseguido congeniar ni una pizca con la protagonista, su forma de ser y de actuar no me han gustado nada 🥲

He de destacar la edición y que la manera de escribir de la autora hace más amena la lectura

Admin thoughts: Sorry but I really have to disagree here. People are trashing Talkloids but not really meme songs. From what I've seen It's Dark (which is an English meme song) is fairly liked. And there always been those silly meme songs in the synth community: PoPiPo, Rin-Chan Now, Kasane Territory, Dancing Samurai etc. It's actually really cool to see the new gen included too

17994135316485480;"⁣The Kite Runner (Khaled Hosseini, 2003)⠀
🪁(7.1/10)⠀
🗣 An Afghan who fled to America returns to Kabul for redemption, to do good, to be good again. ⠀
🛠 What a story. Satisfying to bits. But pardon my #unpopularopinion 
⠀
There are 3 kinds of people in the world based on who they associate the name “Khaled” with. Group 1 thinks “DJ Khaled”. Group 2, the minority, would say “For you, a thousand times over”. Group 3 – the majority/everyone else would say, “that’s an Arabic name.”⠀
 ⠀
Group 2 = readers. Hosseini’s readers. Myself, I’ve read A Thousand Splendid Suns first before The Kite Runner. Both stories had me close to tears. The man has talent. Just like his peers (and my favorites) Messrs. Sparks and Albom, he uses easy, familiar English. Not seeking to impress you with the “intricacy of language”. Just telling it as it is, straight to the point. Action words, simple words, big emotions. How to tug at your heartstrings 101. Except that Hosseini writes about things that are happening. Or must have happened. Somewhere, somehow, the things he writes about are actually taking place. And you must have a heart of stone if you’re not wishing for the cruelty, the abuse, the killings, to stop.⠀
⠀
And here’s my only reservation re: Mr. Hosseini. His fiction is inauthentic. “Survivor’s guilt” my a*s.  I don’t think it’s even accurate. The guy’s a diplomat’s son, had an easy life in what is now Silicon Valley, portraying things that people from the land of his ancestors are certainly experiencing. But he has personally seen none of it; has not experienced the depravity of the Taliban first hand. And yet you’d think he’s the one who knows what hell on earth is! Am I being too harsh? Probably. I’m being pathetic and petty.⠀
⠀
But if you’ve ever been oppressed and marginalized, you’d understand what I mean.⠀
⠀
You don’t let the Senator’s Son be the one to write about your suffering and privations. ⠀
⠀
Mr. Hosseini makes the world a better place. Except his stories are fairy tales. Let’s not forget about that. What he does is give hope. And profits from it. From things he never experienced, things he imagined. Oh here I go again.⠀
⠀
Will the real survivors please stand up.";2022-06-21 14:01:51+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:45.113311+00:00;105;313;en

At least not in the way popular psychology tells you to.

Processing your feelings can have immense benefits if we understand what psychologists actually mean by the suggestion. Do we though? Popular psychology encourages us to focus on our feelings and devote whole days to process them. What does it even mean to process your feelings? How long does it take to process a negative feeling? Do we really need to process every feeling that we experience?

You don’t need to go the the gym to lose weight, HOWEVER! If the goal is to achieve a certain aesthetic, you want to grow glutes or have some muscular detail, then you do need to pick up heavy shit. 

Most people can eat in a calorie deficit and hit a step target and still lose a lot of weight. Heck! One of my long term clients has lost 15kg from barely training at all and simply focusing on those two aspects. 

There more than one way to skin a cat. There are many approaches you can take, whether is be to train in a home gym 5 days a week or in the gym 2 days, the journey will look different for everyone, but one thing is the same, you do need to lift some weights, follow a program, and apply progressive overload.

I don’t think tuning should be a big criticism to this song (or most songs, in fact) because as long as it creates an intentional tone for the song, it works, and this song’s tuning works well. Best vocameme song may be a bit of a stretch, but this song is a damn good bop you should really listen to.

18350189623011739;"the worst part of losing 50 pounds was still being me.

Truth is I used to hate how I looked in the mirror or gauuud forbid a candid shot someone took of me.

even at my ""thinnest"" i would look in the mirror and only see my flaw. A zit, side boob, had to be hidden.
 I’d still cover my belly with pillows of jackets in social situations. 

I was so worried about how I looked I wasn’t living.

So one day about three years ago I wore a crop top out to Mexican restaurant and it was horrific to me, 
yet no one said a thing. 

That’s when It shifted for me. 

I’m my biggest bully and I bet you are too bestie, if someone talked to your kids, hubby or yo momma like that you be ready to whoop some ass. So why is it okay to do it to yourself?!? Mmmhhh I got youuu boo. Don’t believe me? 

Swipe through the photos and tell me of ya don’t see a difference on the INSIDE cuz you see..

The transformation doesn’t happen over night but if you do these three things, you will be surprised who you see in the mirror looking back at you in just a couple weeks.

1. When you catch yourself thinking/saying something negative about ur self stop and give my bestie (aka you) 
3 complements instead 
2. Listen to affirmation daily and say them out loud
 (I’ll drop some below) 
3. When ever you look in the mirror tell yourself something you like about yourself

“Buckhead wasn’t a place you lived. It was a place you survived.”

🚨an unpopular opinion is ahead…

Meet the women of Buckhead - Shannon was once the queen bee but she’s been left by her politician husband for the younger Crystal, Olivia has waited years to take her crown, and Jenny owns the salon where they all gossip amongst and about each other. Plus there’s Karen and Keisha…AKA lots of moving pieces here. I’ve seen lots of rave reviews for this one so I’ll keep mine a bit short. I understand why people love this one - it’s got multiple POVs, a murder you know happened but an unnamed victim, lots of drama, and plenty of Housewives vibes. BUT I think I’ve come to realize that rich people drama just isn’t for me 🤷🏻‍♀️ there wasn’t very many likable characters and while there was development seen there most of it was women trying to tear other women down and that’s just not my jam. 

Overall I’ve rated it 2.5⭐️s - somewhere between okay and I liked it. The characters were hard to tell apart and the ending was rushed but satisfying. The audiobook has a full cast of narrators and I’m glad I listened to it vs read it. Overall, if you’re a fan of housewife drama with a side of mystery I’d recommend it, otherwise not so much.

17966333587676335;"❓¿Libros de los que tengan una opinión impopular?

¡Hola, amigos! El año pasado compré muy emocionada los libros de la foto ya que tenía muchas ganas de leerlos. Había leído maravillas de la pluma de Susana Rubio y no puedo negar que lo que me convenció para comprar la trilogía completa fueron las portadas bellísimas con esos colores pasteles que me vuelven loca. 💖

Bueno… el problema es que odié la historia. Odié a Alexia, la protagonista. Odié la relación con Thiago y odié como se fue desarrollando la historia que, como podrán ver por mis puntuaciones, siento que fue de mal a peor… 🙊

No quise escribir reseña de estos libros porque sinceramente no tengo nada muy positivo para decir y me da mucha pena no haberlos podido disfrutar… pero bueno, no a todos nos gusta lo mismo y es totalmente válido no conectar con alguna historia o con los protagonistas… o con ambos. 😂

Sí tengo que admitir que son libros que, como dice el sticker de la tapa, se leen en menos de 24 hs. De verdad que la pluma de Susana es tan sencilla y tan fresca que te engancha desde la página uno, por eso no se me hizo pesado terminar la trilogía aunque no estuviera conectando con los protagonistas ni aunque pensara que Alexia era una caprichosa e inmadura de primera y que la relación era bastante tóxica para mi gusto… pero como ya dije más arriba, es mi opinión personal y probablemente no estemos de acuerdo ya que son libros que tienen una puntuación bastante alta.

No sé si recomendaría estos libros porque obviamente a mí no me gustaron, pero me da pena ver que otros lectores los hayan disfrutado tanto y siento que el problema lo tengo yo… 😂 así que si se animan a darle una oportunidad, háganlo. Son libros que se leen de un tirón, ideales para un fin de semana relax y una opción ideal para salir de un bloqueo lector.

❓¿Alguna vez odiaron algún libro que todos hayan amado o han amado alguno que la mayoría haya odiado?

Lo que me ha pasado con este libro es que no he entendido a la protagonista. Hay tanta información secreta que he perdido el hilo en varias ocasiones y eso me ha sacado mucho de la historia 

En general los personajes me han parecido interesantes pero me hubiese gustado que se detuviera más en el trasfondo de cada uno
 
El libro no es complicado pero prefiero que me den la información poco a poco en lugar de darla todo al final y no entender casi nada durante la lectura

Se supone que en la segunda parte se explicarán muchos temas, pero estos temas me hubiese gustado que los hubieran introducido un poco en el primer libro para no ir tan perdida; solo se nombran 

Hay una trama amorosa que me ha enganchado y de la que me gustaría saber más😏 pero…

Dudo que vaya a leer la segunda parte ya que no me ha gustado tanto este libro como para querer leerla

Tags: #enemiestolovers #secretidentity

De esto que voy buscando algún audiolibro medio entretenido para ponerme mientras hago cosas y me tropiezo con esto. Una novela de Highlanders típica pero que tiene su qué. Y eso es lo bueno de la historia, a pesar de ser típica y predecible, da justo en los puntos que me gustan: secret identity, enemies to lovers y personajes con fuerza. Un jefe de clan firme y bueno y una joven que se mete en más problemas de la cuenta.

Una buena historia con momentos claves que adoro por cómo define a los personajes peeero que no resulta suficiente y falla en su desarrollo. No he notado una evolución como tal sino que la autora va saltando de momento en momento pero no termina de desarrollar a los personajes ni su relación, acabando ésta saliendo medio de sopetón. Es como un esquemático de momentos que se juntan pero les falta ese hilo de unión entre ellos para que vaya de forma fluida.

Tiene una buena idea y momentos que lo harían una historia muy poderosa. Lástima que el desarrollo se quede pobre. Sí, está bien, resulta una historia muy amena para pasar el rato, sobre todo en formato audiolibro, pero todos sus momentos me dejaban con ganas de más y al final es una de esas historias que lees y olvidas al poco.

📚Book Review📚: The Prisoner by B.A. Paris
📅 Pub Date: 11.1.22
🌟TL;DR Review: Not for me 

The Prisoner started off strong and had short quick chapters but the plot was totally unbelievable and over the top. I did’t like or care about the MC and had little interest in what would happen. 

📚Book Review📚: All the Dangerous Things by Stacy Willingham 
📅 Pub Date: 1.10.23
🌟TL;DR Review: Not for me

Let me start by saying I’ve seen almost all 5⭐️ reviews, so clearly I am the unpopular opinion on this one and I think she is just not the author for me. This had more descriptions than plot and the pacing was much too slow. Things pick up at the end just to become wildly unrealistic. I predicted most of the plot and was left frustrated by some explanations for choices that didn’t make sense. My full review for this can be found on goodreads.

🍁Feyre está destrozada. Y aunque tiene a Tamlin a su lado, no sabe cómo puede dejar atrás los recuerdos del pasado... Mientras tanto tampoco sabe cómo mantener en secreto el pacto que hizo con Rhysand, que la mantiene intensamente unida a él. 

🍁En primer lugar decir que antes de leer este libro me habia comido todos los spoiler. Lo que hizo que los plot twist de la historia no me causaron ningún impacto, y quizás esto me jugó bastante en contra, no obstante:

🍁La historia se me hizo bastante sencilla y por momentos lenta. El personaje de Rhysand que me había fascinado en el primer libro se me cayó con tanto lamento. Prefería sus matices grises. Exceptuando los primeros capítulos Feyre me pareció  una hetero básica, con un comportamiento infantil para con Rhysand, y si le sumo la escena del trono de las pesadillas, mejor no digo más, que no quiero que me odie IG 😅 pero tengo una lista con las escenas que hicieron levantar red flags (quien quiera leerla se la paso por MD 😅)

🍁 Positivamente, destacó los capítulos finales, que sí los disfruté. La escena de Star Fall que me pareció una fantasía, y los personajes de Nesta, Azriel y Amren que cada vez que aparecen me dejaban con ganas de saber más.

🍁Continuare la saga, y ojalá mi opinión cambie. Destacar que es solo mi opinión, y una vez más el hype y los spoilers, me jugaron una mala pasada.

18044168377349330;"💭 What’s a book everyone loved but you didn’t?

I was really looking forward to Things We Do In The Dark but sadly it was a huge letdown for me. The story is told in dual timelines but I much preferred the present, in which Paris is accused of murdering her celebrity husband Jimmy. It sure kept me guessing!

On the other hand, the past timeline (and how it connects to present day) was very predictable despite it trying to be dark and gritty. I never warmed to any of the characters and wasn't a fan of Joey (btw, Drew sucks). I got real bored fast after Part 1.

Overall, I found this to be just another run-of-the-mill thriller. It was an okayish read and I’d actually wanted to give it 3 stars until the ending, which I hated. I am not a fan of thrillers that derive pleasure and satisfaction from the dehumanizing and downfall of women, no matter how reprehensible they might be. Plus I’m of the belief that people are layers of grey, not black and white.

Not a bad book but not my cup of tea.

18262141246133502;"Some books just make you want to turn the pages at a rapid pace, they beg you to pick them back up the second you put them down, they monopolise your thoughts and you feel drawn to them.

Things we never got over by Lucy Score was not one of those books for me. 

This book was… full of potential. Had some fun tropes and some great characters. The mistaken twin was fun, the grumpy VS sunshine was wonderful and I just loved the characters in the town. 

However, this story was sadly bogged down by unnecessary amounts of information. The first half of the book just felt like a retelling of anyone’s ordinary day with a kid; grocery shopping, back to school shopping, getting a job, etc. It was BORING. 

Small spoiler ahead!: once the main characters finally bonked and her parents walked in after, the story finally felt like it gained some traction. 

It’s a ⭐️⭐️💫 read for me.

18346750504040143;"Este libro lo habrás visto hasta la saciedad por #Bookstagram. Y yo, pues he caído: #bookstagramMadeMeDoIt 🤭

Se le considera un libro casi de culto, el inicio del subgénero #darkacademia. En un buen tocho de libro donde, para mi, lo más destacable es la construcción de los personajes, pero a la vez me parece excesivamente extenso. 

Desde el inicio de la novela sabes en torno a qué va a girar: un grupo de estudiantes elitistas han asesinado a un compañero. El libro desarrolla los peculiares y oscuros  miembros de la clase de griego clásico y la evolución de su amistad con el narrador, Richard. 

Hay partes bastante dinámicas en las que consigue mantenerte pegada al libro para saber más, pero otras, hacia la mitad del libro, que para mi gusto son demasiado densas. Al tratarse de un grupo de estudiantes de griego clásico se utilizan muchas referencias y citas de filósofos y autores clásicos y puede resultar recargado. Se tratan temas como la belleza, la moralidad, el bien y el mal…

No puedo decir que no me haya gustado (se viene #unpopularopinion), pero para mi no es un 5 estrellas.

17985796156849351;"Buongiorno amici e buon weekend!☀️
.
Oggi vi parlo del libro di Felicia Kingsley ""Ti aspetto a Central Park"", lettura che abbiamo fatto insieme nel mio gruppo di lettura The Dreamers.
.
Faccio una premessa,il romance è un genere che non leggo da parecchio e che non mi appartiene più da molto tempo ma questo mi ha convinta davvero poco e so che vado contro corrente visto il successo sul #booktok
.
Personalmente , la storia c'era ma andava studiata meglio.
Dinamiche messe, secondo me,in momenti sbagliati ,e personaggi che potevano dare più effervescenza e intrigo alla storia stessa; ahimé anche le battute,lette e rilette!
.
Nonostante questo però è stata molto carina la parte dell'editoria,direi affascinante e illuminante, unica parte in cui mi sono emozionata.
Per me il libro è stato un No ma lo consiglio a chi,magari, cerca qualcosa di leggero,non troppo impegnativo senza troppi grandi colpi di scena!

17953013228442305;"I had some really mixed feelings on THIS TIME TOMORROW, y’all. This is the first book I’ve ever read by Emma Straub. It’s her latest and was the most recent selection for my IRL book club.

I love the premise: A woman named Alice turns 40 and accidentally travels back in time to her 16th birthday. I turn 40 in July myself and I’m here for all the life reflections. How did I get to be this old? Where does the time go? Holy shit, I looked great when I was younger and I didn’t even appreciate it! Am I doing the right things with my life? Wonder what would have happened if I made abc life choice instead of xyz? You get the picture. Alice figures out how the time traveling works, and thus has the opportunity to keep going back and redoing her 16th birthday in an attempt to change the outcome of her life. Most importantly, her father is dying and she hopes to figure out how to stop that from happening.

Here’s what didn’t work for me, though … There is LOTS of telling the reader about all of these internal struggles and questions instead of showing and letting us do this work on our own. It’s a pretty standard trope and we are smart readers, so I became quite frustrated at times with how “on the nose” the story was. Although Straub is clearly a good writer, and she sets the story down in the mid-90s quite well, the character of Alice was just a bit flat and predictable for me. Despite this, the book did provoke thoughts and feelings about my own priorities and choices, failures and high points, my child growing up, and my death looming somewhere out there in the future. And there is value in this, for sure. I guess I just wish I read something that made me think about all these same things without overtly saying them over and over.";2023-02-15 17:02:58+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:47.258931+00:00;13;0;en

🔎 Observatorul, Evald Flisar (1,5✨) 🔎 

Barton Fink, un tânăr de 22 de ani, se întâlnește cu prietena lui, actriță de meserie, pentru a-i împărtăși ultima veste aflată: suferă de o boală incurabilă, motiv pentru care mai are un an de trăit. Femeia nu-l crede și îi cere în mod repetat să nu mai trăiască în pielea unor personaje, dar el nu se lasă. Vrea să se bucure de timpul rămas. 

N-am văzut-o pe nicăieri și nu am avut așteptări când am început-o, dar, chiar și așa, nu pot să zic că mi-a plăcut sau că aș reciti-o cândva.

Ce a fost pe gustul meu: 
✅ începutul și ideea originală; 
✅ analizele pe diverse teme tare bine scrise, pe care le-am și subliniat; 
✅ niște jocuri de cuvinte; 
✅ îmbinarea unor aspecte ale literaturii cu povestea; 
✅ coperta. 

Ce nu mi-a plăcut: 
✅ execuția, pentru că am pornit de la o intrigă și am ajuns la total altceva; 
✅ acțiunea care nu mi-a ținut trează curiozitatea, fiind destul de plată și fără evenimente captivante; 
✅ scrierea la persoana a III-a nu mi-a oferit șansa de a mă atașa de personaje;
✅ personajele de umplutură; 
✅ acțiunea care a fost extrem de lungită;
✅ multe detalii irelevante; 
✅ finalul; 
✅ povestea romance care a fost grăbită și parcă venită de nicăieri; 
✅ coincidențele la tot pasul; 
✅ faptul că am terminat-o și am rămas cu întrebări.

Menționez că, după vreo 150 de pagini, mi-am pierdut răbdarea și n-am știut cum să o termin mai repede. Poate, dacă o citeam într-o altă perioadă, mi-ar fi plăcut, dar acum nu a fost cazul. Asta nu înseamnă că nu trebuie să îi dați o șansă. Fiecare carte are cititorii ei. 😊

I didn’t like it. 😬

Let me explain…last month I read Every Summer After. This month, I felt like I was reading that book all over again. Am I the only one who thinks that these are basically the same story? I know, I know. This book was written well before the other one, and I maybe would have liked it more had I read it first. But I didn’t, so… I’ve also realized that this is just not the trope for me. I had a high school sweetheart who I (thankfully 🙏🏼) didn’t end up with, so I’m really not into kids being in love and then having their own lives and then falling in love again. This is ONE HUNDRED PERCENT a ME thing, but I’ve learned that I’ll be avoiding this trope from here on out. 💛

Did I love it? No. 😬 I didn’t hate it though. And there was a solid twist that I did not see coming at all, so that’s why it got the extra 1/2 star. I enjoy this author team, and I will absolutely read more of their books. This one just wasn’t for me. 💗

#tysiącpocałunków to opowieść o prawdziwej przyjaźni, bratnich duszach, bezmiernej miłości i trudach życia.

Cztery kluczowe momenty, które zmieniły życie Runa. Młodego Norwega, który przybył do Stanów i spotkał ubrudzoną dziewczynkę z kokardą we włosach. 

Prezent od ukochanej babci, który rozpoczął nową przygodę dwójki przyjaciół. Szklany słój z tysiącem papierowych serc. Każde z nich z przeznaczeniem na pocałunek zapierający dech w piersiach. 

Książka z początku bardzo mi się podobała. Jednak im dalej tym miałam więcej mieszanych uczuć. Z natury jestem niepoprawną romantyczką i mimo tego momentami było ... za słodko? A historia nie jest wcale tak różowa, jak sugerowałaby okładka.

Un hombre obsesionado con una mujer por cincuenta años, porque eso no es amor, es obsesión (parafraseando 😜). Un hombre que se aprovecha de una niña de 14 años!

Creo que no hay ni un solo personaje en esta novela que me haya gustado, has el doctor Juvenal que parecía más serio resultó un infiel.

📚Summary: Chances are, you already know what this book is about so I’m going short and sweet with the summary. Peyote Trip works in Hell where his job is to get people to sell their souls. The ultimate goal is to get an entire family to sell their souls in one deal. Peyote thinks he’s found the perfect mark in the Harrisons who hide some dark secrets. The narrative bounces back and forth between Peyote and each of the Harrisons as Peyote waits for the perfect moment to make the deal.

🤔💭: Everyone’s loving this book and while I do appreciate its originality, I just couldn’t get into it. I was very into the world building part of Hell and found the author’s portrayal to be funny and clever. The part that ruined the book for me was the Harrison storyline. I couldn’t find any of their characters remotely likable or interesting. I would have much preferred the POV stay on Peyote and the Hell side of things as that was much more entertaining. 

My rating: ⭐️⭐️💫//5

There I said it.

And the After series is a good example of that – at least for me. The books are a bit longwinded. They seriously took me forever to read them. Actually, I still have to read Before, but that’ll happen eventually. The story was intriguing, but I would much rather watch the movies, even if they’re slightly different.

QOTD Writing this review made me feel a bit sad as I don’t like writing negative book reviews, so tell me something that made you happy this week?

📖 Book Review 📖

Mr 4 picked out Big Nate:Payback Time by Lincoln Peirce  just purely based on cover alone. I swear I’m not teaching him things 🤣

Big Nate Payback time is a graphic/comic novel based on short stories of Nate ending with him getting even with payback. 

There were some dry humour scenarios but at certain times I felt it wasn’t suitable for a children's book or at least for my children at least. I actually ended up stopping reading this book to the children and actually continuing on reading this one myself. 

Here’s why:

Yes, with an age rating +7 (and me not being a prude) I thought words or phrases like “caress my body” -a name for a perfume, “hi ladies” or “babe-a-licious” aren't very suitable for those middle graders. 

Idk, I could be wrong 😑 but it wasn’t something I was prepare to read to my children.

And the amount of bullying in this book was incredible, using words like “butt nugget” and “loser” wasn’t something I was expecting. I can understand how this book is portraying how students get bullied but surely there could be other ways this could be raised? 

I did however like the mention of Steven Tyler, the lead singer of Aerosmith even though it was a case of mistaken name identity of a president- John Tyler. 

I think this is something as a parent/carer/adult I would definitely check before you buy or read this book for your child/children. 

I can see how this book might be suitable for some children, so please note this is just my own personal opinion of this particular book.

17975565034623144;"⭐️⭐️⭐️💫 BOOK REVIEW
🌶🌶🌶

This is my second book by Colleen Hoover. I try to not base an author off of one piece of work.

QOTD: Do you trust #bookstagram? Why or why not?

“The world was her manuscript. No surface was safe.”

Imagine the hardest eye roll ever, put that in an emoji and that’s my reaction to this book.

What a letdown. I tried so hard to like this one, to see it from different angles, but all I kept coming back to was, she could have done so much better with the end. It had potential. So sad.

“The kiss was full of both desire and respect - two things a lot of men didn’t seem to know could go hand in hand.”

The build was exceptional. She had phenomenal truths about men and how women see men. Some of her quotes were captivating. And let me tell you - check the trigger warnings because there is some twisted imaginative shit in this book (to do with young kids). But the end was nothing close to satisfactory for me. It’s as if the publishing company told her to change it, or she didn’t know where she was going with the story.

If I wrote this book, I would have made the husband the writer, fed Lowen lies about his wife who he tried to kill but was unsuccessful, killed his own kids and now keeps his wife hostage in return for the life of his son. I would have written that he read Lowen’s work, fell for her character, decided to have Lowen to replace Verity as his wife by stalking her and manipulating her. I even thought he could hold her captive in the house. I would have made Lowen walk away without knowing what her husband truly was, but hinting at it to the reader.

CoHo had every opportunity to home run this one out of the ballpark but took a much boring way out.

If you’re asking if I’m team manuscript or team letter, I like the idea of the manuscript better, but written by someone *else* in the house. Someone who would have loved to have toyed with Lowen. Someone who would have done anything to keep her all for himself - like make her believe his ex-wife was a psycho. 🤷🏻‍♀️

⁣
🍹Decir que estaba deseando leer este libro es poco. Desde el mismo momento que se anunció su publicación sabía que quería leerlo⁣
⁣
🍹En primer lugar porque los dos primeros libros de la autora me encantaron. Y también porque las críticas que estaba viendo eran muy buenas. ⁣
⁣
🍹Bueno, pues sea por el hype o sea porque no ha sido para mi, os diré que el libro me ha decepcionado bastante. La trama es muy buena, pero creo que no se ha sabido desarrollar de manera que me enganche. ⁣
⁣
🍹Y me da mucha rabia, porque os aseguro que el último 30% del libro es buenísimo, muy muy bueno. Pero no compensa el 70% restante en donde creo que se podía haber jugado un poco más a dar pistas al lector para entender la trama. Y haberlo desarrollado con más acción. Es una parte muy larga y que se hace muy lenta. Y como digo, aunque el final lo he disfrutado mucho, no creo que recomiende el libro ni compense leerlo entero para disfrutar solo el final. ⁣
⁣
🍹Ahora mismo me encuentro en la situación de que los dos primeros libros de la autora me han encantado, el tercero me dejó muy fría y éste último ya os he explicado lo que me ha transmitido. Por lo que no sé si seguiré leyendo los libros que publique más adelante. ⁣

18200046061217023;"🍰 Review 🍰

Sir Arthur's famous literary detective is revamped as Charlotte Holmes, a misfit feminist with a weakness for cake. Alias: Sherlock Holmes. [Is it really an alias if you keep one of your actual names as part of the alias?]

I feel like I'm (lately) in the minority with this opinion, but...I didn't really like this book. I was mostly confused, which began very early on but, for some reason, propelled me onward to the finish line. There are no scarlet women in this book; there are several *fallen* women, but they aren't prostitutes. This allusion to the title of the original Holmesian story had me furrowed and side-eyeing the page margin for much of the first half, waiting for the hookers to show up. Or is a scarlet woman not a scarlet woman anymore?

The mystery unfolds in a disjointed and coincidental spew, which makes it almost impossible to participate in or even follow. Maybe this is intentionally derivative of Arthur Conan Doyle—I wouldn't know—but if that's the case, then it would've been best to let sleeping dogs lay.

However! I'm interested in the relationship between Charlotte and possible spy/assassin, Lord Ingram because it's one of the few plot threads that I found appealing. Is that a compelling enough reason to move on to book two? Hmm, good question, Jenny, good question... 🤔

17954459213402030;"My heart sank as I read those oh so familiar words that once brought so much suffering to me…

I understand it’s not the authors intentions to harm the chronic illness and disability community and that there are many nuances to this story, but without context, these words can be harmful to those others might not be aware 

My community has been incredible to get me to where I am today, but they are not without mistakes and without faults. I too was surrounded and buried underneath ableism and toxic positivity. 

The people around me could not support me emotionally in the way I needed to, that is why I found Generation Lyme who offered weekly support groups 4 days a week. Now I think we’re up to at least 5 days a week?

In those groups I hear it echoed every. Single. Meetup… People around them do not know how to hold space. None of us were taught how to emotionally care for others and most of us were raised by imperfect people who also deserved better.

Being cycle breaker and offering all the unconditional love and support to those around me has been quite difficult in giving what I haven’t received myself. But I take pride in always trying my best to unlearn learnt behaviours and giving as much kindness as I can.

Learning is a life long journey that we must learn to unlearn harmful beliefs and relearn more constructive ways of thinking to support many marginalized communities. 

I practice intersectionality in my daily life being a Chinese Canadian, interracial adoptee living in a western country and a chronically ill dynamically disabled spoonie who is now in remission from chronic illness. Will you join me in this life long venture of learning?

Slow. Heart-wrenching. Surprising.

I know this is an unpopular opinion as this book is everywhere on #bookstagram but it did not live up to the hype for me.  It was almost a DNF for me…twice.  The beginning was very slow. The narrator is unreliable and I just didn’t like her, to be honest. The story was sad, but the ending was very surprising. However, even with all the twists and turns at the end, it didn’t make up for the first half of the book being hard to get through. I love thrillers, but unfortunately this wasn’t my jam.

I haven’t read Flicker in the Dark yet, but I do plan to read it soon. I’m not giving up on this author yet!

17929206032570271;"Hannah’s Review -
Verity - Colleen Hoover

So tonight I find myself in another ‘drop this review and run hiding from the baying mob’ situation, although, I guess maybe not a surprising one! I’ve avoided the Coho train for a good year now, Rhi has dabbled and enjoyed her books, and suggested that this may be the one for me to try. I have to say, If this was the one that could have hooked me, I’m bloody pleased I didn’t pick up any of the others! She is definitely not for me.

Starting positively, what I WILL say, is that I did want to find out the ending of the book, there was a little intrigue as to what the fuck was actually going on halfway through… so, that’s a kind of positive thing? Maybe?! However, it was a real struggle to get there, my eyes rolled so many times I’m surprised they didn’t fall out of my skull, and, the ending itself was so stupid that I actually hated myself a little for sticking with it. So, yeah, not so positive at all in the end! 

The protagonist was pretty pathetic and I was a little bit sick in my mouth at just how much she mooned over Jeremy, who was just plain unrealistic and not believable in the slightest. The one character who had any kind of interesting qualities was Verity, and even she was rendered very boring by the end. This read like an episode of a very bad soap opera, just when you think it can’t get any more ridiculous it does. 

It’s a thriller, so (if my review hasn’t put you off it) I won’t spoil anything for you, but there was of course a few twists and turns, some I could see coming a mile away, the biggest one I didn’t suspect, but it also was the nail in the coffin of this absolute waste of 2 days of my life. 

CoHo? It’s a  NoHo for me.

17951446748309478;"Book Review 🗝️

The Inheritance Games is a classic rags to riches story with an exciting twist. Avery is a high schooler, who sleeps out of her car most nights. Her mom died at a young age; her dad is MIA. Out of the blue, she is summoned to Texas, for a multi-billionaire has included her in his will. 

The twist: Avery has never met him. Why would Mr. Hawthorne leave her with his wealth and extravagant estate, rather than his two children & four grandsons?

The boys soon realize that their quick-witted grandfather devised a final game before his death. Throughout the novel, the kids solve riddles to learn why Avery was chosen. Some clues lead to dead ends, others lead to near death experiences. 

While the plot is definitely intriguing, I didn’t love the book! I felt like I could have read this when I was in middle/high school, which left me feeling bored and wanting more depth. There are also two major turn of events at the end; one of which I guessed. The other, however, was super shocking, and redeemed me from giving TIG a lower rating. 

I did admire the character development and how well the last few pages set up the second book in the series. I plan to read it eventually but am not in a rush to do so anytime soon.

17921106095577768;"✨Unpopular Opinion✨

So this book is all over the place right now and I’ve seen more than one review that has already lauded it as “the best book of all time.” While I understand its appeal, this one just wasn’t for me. I’m not into mobster-type thrillers and found this to be quite boring. I called it quits after about 25% because I figured if I was bored already, the remaining 400+ pages were going to feel like an eternity. I was dreading picking this up each day. It probably is a wonderful book for the right reader, but that reader is not me. 🤷‍♀️

So just a friendly reminder to anyone who needs to hear this today: it’s okay to not like a really popular book! Not every book is for every reader. You have permission to DNF and move onto something else. 🥰

📚Summary: Lowen is a struggling writer when an offer that seems too good to be true lands in her lap. She is asked to complete the infamous Virtues series when Verity Crawford, the original author, experiences a tragic accident that leaves her bedridden and incapacitated. Verity’s husband offers to let Lowen stay at their house to go through Verity’s office. While there, Lowen finds herself drawn to Verity’s husband and the family’s tragic past. When she discovers an autobiography Verity wrote, Lowen is shocked by what she reads and can no longer tell fact from fiction.

🤔💭: Don’t come after me with pitchforks CoHo fans, but…yikes! Why is this book so hyped? I was intrigued at the onset by the gruesome opening and flew through the first half. I can see why readers enjoy her writing style, but there was so much about this plot that didn’t work for me. First of all, there were random tangents that didn’t end up going anywhere. Also, I get this is a romantic thriller, but the amount of sex in this was excessive. Pages and pages and pages of sex scenes that did nothing to advance the story. And that ending! I hate endings like that. They feel lazy to me and make it too easy to explain away major plot holes. I think this definitely had a lot of potential, but the execution was a huge miss for me.

A huge thanks to Caitlin over at readingonfordearlife who buddy read this one with me! She sure did get an earful from me. 😜

🗣Tell me a book that everyone else loved, but you didn’t.

Popping in on a Tuesday for a hot take of a review! 

Someone please tell me what the point of this book is and why it has such high ratings……..

Because literally nothing happens. It’s just punk wannabe MC Art bumbling around for 280 pages and some random (albeit slightly strange) run ins with this girl named Mercy (if that’s really her real name). That’s it. It’s not that out there. I didn’t get a supernatural or a horror element from this. Art just seemed like he had a very vivid imagination and was easily influenced. 

One caveat is this - the format itself is unique. I liked the concept of Mercy kind of “reviewing” Art’s memoir/novel. But it wasn’t developed enough and the rest of the story wasn’t enough to hold my interest. 

In conclusion, I must really be missing something. As in…. the point of this book entirely apparently. Someone halp. 

Have you read this? On your radar? What did you think??

Zodiac Academy: Cursed Fates by Caroline Peckham and Susanne Valenti
3.5/5 🌟

🚨 UNPOPULAR OPINION 🚨

I should have known this book wouldn't be a happy one based on the title but I didn't expect literally everyone's life to fall apart. First let me start off by saying I liked a lot of things in this book but I also disliked an equal number of things. This book could have easily been 200-300 pages shorter. The flow was better than the last one but huge chunks of time just flew by with very little mention. Once again, a lost opportunity to use Gabriel to his potential as a nebula alley. It seems like the authors just throw him in there for the sole purpose of moving the story along. Multiple dumb decisions were made. Not to mention, breaking the heart of my most favorite character! The ending was horrible. I found myself speed reading to get through it. Basically, anything that could go wrong, did. The sad twist was not sad and honestly not a twist. The fight scene made no sense. The shocker ending was unnecessary and unbelievable based on info given in previous books. I'm so annoyed right now with this series (even four days later). If I hadn't already invested over 3,000 pages worth of my time then I'd probably stop reading. But as it is, I'm going to take a step back and read something else for a while. Maybe I'll come back to it 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

💬 Have you ever given up on a series when you've invested a lot of time in it already? Or do you suck it up and finish what you started?

You don’t have to be in the Christmas spirit…⁣
With all the advent calendars openings, the gifting guides and newly decorated Christmas trees on display on Instagram, it can be overwhelming for those who find the Holiday period challenging.⁣
⁣
For years, this time of the year was not a happy one for me. It reminded me of the inexistant relationships I had with my father since I was a young teenager. After my grandfather passed away, it was then another time to remind me and my family that there was an empty seat at the table and since I moved to the UK and met my OH it meant leaving him behind so we could spend Christmas with our respective families in two different countries. So for years, the month of December was actually a constant reminder of what I was or would be missing.⁣
⁣
But on Christmas Day 2021, as if the stars aligned to make things right, our son blessed us with his arrival so this day could be once more a special one for me. During my whole pregnancy I wished that he wouldn’t be born on Christmas Day as I thought it would not be great for him while growing up to have HIS special day mixed with so many other people’s. But now I realise that the fact that he was born on the 25th of December is just what I needed. For the rest of my life, I’ll be able to say that I received the best present ever and be able to rejoy and look forward to this day so special for so many and for me too as well now finally.⁣
⁣
All that to say… if you’re struggling in this Holiday period, please know that you’re certainly not the only one. It’s always ok not to be ok, and it applies to Christmas time too ❤️";2022-12-04 20:43:15+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:49.427382+00:00;109;1133;en

Mais très vite, il y a eu deux sortes de retour…les très négatifs et les très positifs…vu qu’à l’époque j’ étais en plein déménagement et j’avais un manque de temps flagrant…j’ai passé mon tour.

Cette année, le voilà en poche, et la curiosité a été la plus forte. Alors je fais partie de quelle team?

La team : mais quel gâchis !!!

L’idée générale du bouquin, qui vous sera révélée uniquement sur les dernière pages est bonne, il y avait matière à faire vraiment une histoire incroyable, avec une construction passé / présent pour découvrir ce sanatorium.

Bon déjà, je vous le dis, il n’y a pas de construction où l’on voyage dans le passé du sanatorium….déception ultime.

Notre personnage principal : Elin…je n’ai rien compris sur ce personnage qui trimballe un trauma du passé, un trauma récent de son boulot…qui se retrouve à enquêter sur la disparition de son amie et sur son trauma d’enfance…c’est très brouillon et son cheminement plutôt confus. Quand au dénouement , je ne suis pas vraiment pas convaincue.

Dans les critiques mis en avant sur la quatrième de couverture vous pouvez lire « thriller gothique »…NON !!!! Jamais de la vie c’est un thriller gothique. Un « air de shining »….même pas de loin et de dos .

The Fine Print by Lauren Asher

Okay, y’all. This is one of those situations where, for me, the book didn’t live up to the hype. I have seen this series EVERYWHERE, and I was nervous and excited to read it. However, this book left me underwhelmed.

There isn’t anything that stood out for me to set this book apart. Of course the billionaire is a grumpy a**hole. Of course the sunshine girl makes him rethink everything. It just felt like I’ve heard this story a million times before but with Disney thrown in. 

Now I did enjoy the deep dive into Rowan’s past and why he is the way he is. But that’s about it. I didn’t find this to be all that memorable, and I don’t plan on continuing the series. 

It wasn’t horrible, it just wasn’t great. 
⭐️⭐️⭐️

**the audiobook was great thanks to Aiden Snow-but I think if I had been reading instead of listening, I would’ve gotten bored.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.25

Read this series if you like:
😡Enemies to Lovers
☀️Grumpy x Sunshine
💰Billionaire Brothers
💖Relatable Female Main Characters
🫶Dual POV
🏢Boss/Employee Romance
👏(all on Kindle Unlimited)

What I loved:
okay WOWWW, I did not expect to love these books so dang much! And I blew right through them. We get to see each of the Miles Brothers on their own journey to find love - and themselves. For the most part they are billionaire grumps and the women they become interested in could care less about their money. I’m was worried every story would be the same, but the author was really good at developing each of the brothers characters to be different and have their own flaws. Recommended to read in order (below) as the timeline flows that way, but they can be read as standalone. 

What I didn’t love:
Honestly, I don’t think much BUTTTT most of the stories follow the boss/employee trope or they run in the same industry. I think there was room to differentiate this a little bit BUT I also recognize this was where the initial relationship developed. The Do-Over is the most different from them all in that aspect. I wish we could have seen more of the female MC’s family dynamic and how that could play into the story. This series overall was fantastic and kept me engaged throughout!

⠀
Hoy vengo con la reseña de “En plena noche” de Mikel Santiago. Libro que hemos leído durante el mes de febrero en el club #Unlibroalmes .⠀
⠀
⠀
¿Puede una noche marcar el destino de todos los que la vivieron? Han pasado más de veinte años desde que Diego Letamendia, estrella del rock en declive, actuó por última vez en su pueblo natal, Illumbe. Esa fue la noche del final de su banda y su grupo de amigos, y también la de la desaparición de Lorea, su novia. La policía nunca logró esclarecer lo ocurrido con la chica, que fue vista saliendo a toda prisa de la sala de conciertos, como si huyera de algo o de alguien. Después de aquello, Diego emprendió una carrera de éxitos en solitario y jamás regresó al pueblo.⠀
⠀
Cuando uno de los miembros de la banda muere en un extraño incendio, Diego decide volver a Illumbe. Han pasado muchos años y el reencuentro con los antiguos amigos es difícil: ninguno de ellos sigue siendo la persona que fue. Mientras, crece la sospecha de que el incendio no fue accidental. ¿Es posible que todo esté relacionado y que, tanto tiempo después, Diego pueda encontrar nuevas pistas sobre lo que pasó con Lorea?⠀
⠀
⠀
Esta es la segunda novela que leo de Mikel porque quise darle una segunda oportunidad a su pluma, pero es de esos casos en los que no conectas con el escritor por mucho que lo intentes. ⠀
Por la sinopsis que leo me esperaba otra cosa y me encontré con algo que hizo que perdiera todo el interés en la historia, sobretodo por ese final tan surrealista y el gran número de páginas que veo totalmente innecesarias para lo que acaba pasando. Los personajes no me decían nada y tanto relleno para nada consiguió que me desinflara totalmente. ⠀

Rachel prend le même train pour se rendre au travail matin et soir. Sur le trajet, elle aperçoit son ancien quartier et un couple qui habite près de la voie ferrée. Elle imagine leur vie idyllique alors que la sienne part en vrille. Jusqu'au jour où le visage de la femme, Megan, fait la une des journaux : elle est portée disparue. Rachel serait-elle la seule témoin, depuis le train, susceptible de comprendre ce qui est arrivé à Megan ?

Défini comme un thriller psychologique, La Fille du train a eu beaucoup de succès à sa sortie. Mais ça ne l'a pas fait avec moi.

Les trois narratrices deviennent petit à petit attachantes, à force de pathos. Rachel a tout d'une véritable anti-héroïne, alcoolique, amnésique parfois, qui cherche toujours à se rassurer et à s'immiscer dans la vie des autres. On suit également Megan et Anna dans une moindre mesure.
Et... c'est à peu près tout. Ça manque de personnages et c'est pour ça que j'ai deviné le coupable dès les premiers chapitres. Il suffit de se demander quelle est la seule personne qui relie les trois narratrices...

Le récit est donc tellement prévisible que ma lecture a été longue, très longue. L'auteure s'embourbe dans des scènes de la vie quotidienne et du glauque pour du glauque, qui ne font pas avancer l'intrigue ni monter le suspense. Certes je n'ai pas tout vu venir, et il y a quelques révélations intéressantes.

Ce roman noir sera peut-être passionnant pour vous si vous ne devinez pas la fin. Mais personnellement, il n'a pas réussi à m'emporter...

Qué estáis leyendo? 

Yo últimamente no acierto con mis lecturas... Hoy os traigo otra decepción. 

Se trata de un libro muy famoso por aquí, Romper el círculo.
Tengo que decir que me gusta mucho la forma de escribir de la autora, es ágil y engancha. 

Lily es nuestra protagonista,  que después de morir su padre decide dejar su trabajo y montar su propio negocio. Una floristería. 

Una noche, en una azotea conoce a Ryle, un médico bastante arrogante que le propone sexo sin compromiso, ya que no quiere enamorarae. Que ella no acepta, pero la vida hará que sus caminos se cruzen y él se enamore de ella. 

También conoceremos,el amor del pasado Atlas (la única parte que me gustó) de Lily cuando ella encuentra su diario y nos narra su historia. 

Mi decepción con este libro ha sido con la relación actual de la protagonista. Se ve a leguas como es Ryle, ella sabe lo que es una relación abusiva y parece que lo quiere olvidar. 

Y lo peor...
Esto es spoiler asi que si no lo queréis saber no sigáis leyendo. 

Os he avisado, luego no os quejéis😂
Enserio. Esto es spoiler, os he avisado. 

Ryle le pega varias veces y ella sigue con él, no lo denuncia y aunque al final se dejan... él sigue en su vida, siendo amigos. La hermana de Ryle le da la razón a Lily y no hace naaaaada. Y por encima, Lily tiene un hijo con ese ser y no se preocupa de que la maltrate? No sé, yo soy Lily y ni de coña le dejo a mi hija. 
Por eso no me ha gustado, el tío es un maltratador, la excusa es que no controla su carácter ... No me convence enserio. 

Pero es mi opinión, sé que es unpopular, porque veo reseñas buenísimas pero no todos tenemos los mismos gustos😂

""Diese Momente hier drin...《Sie tippt sich an ihre Stirn,...sind genauso wirklich wie alles andere. ...Behalte ihn bei dir. ...Hilf ihm dabei, weiterzuleben."" (Zitat aus 'Bleib bei mir, Sam', Seite 316) 🌸🌸🌸
 
So gerne hätte ich 'Bleib bei mir, Sam' richtig geliebt. Ich finde die Idee hinter der Geschichte und die hoffnungsvollen und heilsamen Gedanken wunderschön. Leider bin ich mit der Umsetzung nicht zurecht gekommen, ich habe Handlung vermisst und die Protagonisten waren für mich nicht greifbar. Auch die Emotionen sind bei mir nicht angekommen. Aber, das Buch beinhaltet einige schöne Aussagen, die ich für mich mitnehmen konnte, weshalb ich dann doch noch 3 Sterne vergebe.

17920797710386253;"“This is a Hallmark movie.Or a poorly written young adult novel”. - Olive, The Love Hypothesis.
It might be a line from the book, but how nicely it represents my thoughts on the book, when everyone else seems to have enjoyed reading this one, here’s my UNPOPULAR OPINION!!!

🌟/5

I am not getting into the blurb of this Bestselling shit, it’s more of academia, professors, researchers, and most importantly FAKE-DATING, with everything fake going around! 𝗡𝗢 𝗣𝗟𝗢𝗧, 𝗡𝗢 𝗖𝗛𝗔𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧𝗘𝗥𝗦!!

Coming to the two most important characters: Adam “Ass” Carlsen & Olive “Smart-ass”, Strictly speaking, Adam felt very very bland to me. It was difficult to understand his personality, other than being moody and sullen, “antagonistic” and “unapproachable” because this is what we read about him in all pages of this book! I was left thinking how did he fall for Olive, why did he fall for Olive, but no… there wasn’t really anything! Although there was one portion where I liked him, where he get to know how great a scientist he is! That’s it!! 

Olive’s personality felt childish. The whole book we dont know how she looks like, and all we know about her is that she is a PhD student and a Canadian, with a sad childhood. The writing is so poor, and such less information shared about the characters, it was very difficult to enjoy the book! 

At times I felt that the first real kiss between the two didn’t feel fake, and I liked the emotional word play there, but then again the author has terribly failed to keep up the chemistry and the romance felt off!𝗜𝗧 𝗙𝗘𝗟𝗧 𝗦𝗢 𝗕𝗢𝗥𝗜𝗡𝗚!

Even the side characters felt so boring, Anh, Olive’s best friend. Some of the situations with her around could have been better if she and Olive were to act like adults as they were.

And chapter 16- the over hyped one?𝗜𝗧 𝗪𝗔𝗦 𝗥𝗜𝗗𝗜𝗖𝗨𝗟𝗢𝗨𝗦! It might work for teens, but sadly not really recommended for romance lovers as well! 

Well, if there was anything that I laughed at, it’s the sheer stupidity of this book!

17975015770643119;"💥 Unpopular Opinion 💥

Sorrow and Bliss is a book about a woman called Martha. She knows something is wrong with her but doesn't know what it is. Her husband Patrick thinks she is fine. He says everyone has something; the thing is just to keep going. Sounds very intriguing so far, right?! And with so many positive reviews, we just had to pick this one up! Unfortunately, after finishing it, our opinions are... mixed at best.
🤯
Martha told Patrick that she didn't want to have children before they got married. He said he didn't mind either way because he has loved her since he was fourteen, and making her happy is all that matters, although he does not seem able to do it. This intrigued us, as well. As a married couple, we would like to read more about decisions like that in the books.
🤯
By the time Martha finds out what is wrong, it doesn't really matter anymore. It is too late to get the only thing she has ever wanted. Or maybe it will turn out that you can stop loving someone and start again from nothing - if you can find something else to want.
🤯
The book essentially tells a story about mental health. It is a very important and very unusual story. It shows how people are dealing with their daily lives, how it affects relationships, work, etc. However, we both found this book extremely hard to read because of the writing style. Sentences are fractured, narrative and scenes are all over the place. We could not connect to Martha and generally struggled to finish the book. Nerijus was on the verge of DNF'ing while Ingrid worked through it.
🤯
We both sat down, ready to tear the book to pieces, but the questions we asked have put many things in perspective. The writing style is deliberate - it transports you into Martha's head to try to show how she struggles with her daily life. Relationships are displayed one-sided on purpose again. We don't know the other half of the story. Never naming the illness was an interesting touch; it kept the reader guessing.
🤯
Overall it was a strange experience. We are still not big fans of this story, but we are probably missing something important here!

⭐️⭐️💫
2.5 stars combined from both of us
3 from Ingrid, 2 from Nerijus";2022-08-15 07:21:25+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:51.310903+00:00;40;679;en

❓What’s your favorite kind of music to listen to while you’re reading?

❗️Currently my friend’s husband is playing the piano while I’m writing this review. Perfect reading setup for me. 

Contemporary Romance
Pub date: February 7th
First person present tense, single POV

In Just My Type, LP and her high school ex boyfriend, Seth have to go head to head for a job. They’re tasked with weekly challenges for the serial monogamist LP to get used to being single and for Seth to find a long term relationship. 

I liked this book, it was cute and easy to read but there were also a lot of things that bugged me or didn't make sense to me. I enjoyed her debut book, Lease on Love more. 

👍
+ The romance was super cute. I love second chance romance, and I could truly feel their connection throughout the book. How they clearly still loved one another even if they’re in denial about it. It all wrapped up quite adorably by the end too.
+ I liked where the author took the concept of learning to be by yourself, and learning who you really are. You don’t have to be single to learn how to stand on your own two feet.
+ LP’s boss is… a piece of work, and it was cool to see how LP slowly recognizes the toxic patterns. 
+ Other stuff: strong friendships, complicated mother-daughter relationship, in depth therapy sessions on page. 

👎
- I couldn’t stand the main character for most of the book, she comes across very immature, and thinks the whole world revolves around her. 
- The emotional resolution of a lot of the problems are very surface. She attends a single event, and is cured of her anger towards her ex, she attends another and is cured of her resentment towards her mom and so on.
- I wasn’t a fan of how some of the misunderstandings were resolved between Seth and LP. 
- There are a lot of weird unexplained and unresolved details. Like what happened with #LongTermPotential, why Seth seemingly keeps going hot and cold etc.
- LP uses Marvel’s Thor/Loki in place of God in common sayings. 
- Icky scene where LP says she can kiss a gay guy because it won’t mean anything to him. 

My rating: 3⭐

Pour moi le défaut majeur de ce roman, c’est qu’il est trop long, bien trop long. Si l’idée de départ est séduisante, l’autrice se perd dans des détails qui cassent le rythme et donnent l’impression de piétiner. L’intrigue est dense, lente à se mettre en place et le mystère trop peu stimulant pour la rendre haletante. Sans la promesse de passer un bon moment, je l’aurai abandonné avant la moitié. Je ne ressentais aucun attachement ni aucune empathie pour Émilia, l’héroïne trop effacée et stéréotypée. Ce roman retrace sa prise de conscience et sa métamorphose mais cette dernière arrive bien trop tardivement si bien que j’ai eu le temps d’être agacée par sa passivité, sa naïveté et sa soumission. Son cheminement sera laborieux, sinueux et ennuyeux. Les morceaux choisis du passé de sa tante Poppy sont à l’inverse bien plus intéressants mais trop peu nombreux, créant un déséquilibre flagrant entre les deux temporalités.

La partie dans le présent se veut feel-good mais manque cruellement d’originalité et de saveur. Les descriptions sont assez impersonnelles et peu immersives, à se demander si l’autrice est déjà partie en Italie… Je n’ai clairement pas voyagé.

Et puis passée la moitié du roman, un déclic. L’action s’accélère, Emilia se révèle, le voile est levé sur le passé. J’ai d’ailleurs lu cette deuxième partie d’une traite. Et si je conviens que c’est une jolie histoire pleine de messages cela ne suffira pas à la rendre exceptionnelle à mes yeux… En écrivant ce billet, mes souvenirs de cette lecture s’estompe déjà…";2023-02-01 15:24:51+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:51.326564+00:00;31;181;fr
17943361525851689;"💙 BENEATH THE STAIRS - REVIEW 💙

Author: Jennifer Fawcett
Genre: Thriller / Mystery (labeled as Horror but I did not agree) 
Rating: 🌟🌟 (2/5 stars)
TW: yes, DM me!
*THANK YOU to atriabooks for my ARC of this one! I am so thankful to you all!*

SHORT SYNOPSIS:
Clare returns to her hometown after 20 years, upon hearing that her childhood best friend Abby attempted suicide in the haunted Octagon House that traumatized them in their teenage years. 

MY THOUGHTS:
I am so upset!!!! I wanted to LOVE this one. It is no secret that thrillers are my absolute favorite books/genre. Maybe since I have read so many, there just aren't a lot of them that wow me? 

I had seen some glowing reviews, and friends saying it was so spooky and creepy (which I love)... but none of that happened for me. 😭 I definitely would not consider this a horror novel. There were hardly any actual haunted house/spooky atmospheric vibes?? I felt like the alternating timelines were just confusing and kind of took away the focus of the main storyline. There were characters and chapters that just felt like filler, that didn't add anything to the story, and other parts just felt very repetitive. About halfway in, the plot just felt like it was starting to fall apart. There was no reveal or thrilling ending.

Overall, I feel like the story just fell flat and didn't really go anywhere at all. And I am so sad about that. It really did have so much potential, but the execution just didn't do it for me.

**As mentioned before, I do know several people who really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it, so I don't discourage anyone from trying it for themselves!**

🤍 Are new to the thriller genre
🤍 Enjoy multiple POVs and alternating timelines

First off, I rated this book 4.5⭐️ right when I finished it but the more I thought about the book and compared it to the other books I’ve read by coho, this was one of my least favorites from her. I know it’s an unpopular opinion! Don’t come after me!

The story was so difficult to read emotionally. I have a 3 year old daughter and I just couldn’t imagine losing her and not being able to see her at all. It would kill me. I thought the story was rushed too. There was just a lot of holes that never got filled in my opinion. I think I’ll still give it a 4 just because it’s coho and it made me shed a tear or two at the end.

A Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J. Maas

When Feyre kills a wolf in the woods in order to claim a deer to feed her starving family, a terrifying creature arrives soon after to demand retribution. She is dragged to a magical land she has only heard about through legends, and she discovers her captor is one of the immortal faeries who once ruled her world. As Feyre adapts to her new home, she realizes something isn’t right in the faerie lands. Feyre must find a way to stop the growing shadow or doom Tamlin and his world forever. 

Okay, unpopular opinion time, please don’t hate me. I just thought this one was just…okay. I felt it moved slowly and even drug out in some places. I do understand for the first book in a series there needs to be a lot of world and character building, which there was, but I felt it lacked something. It may just be me lacking a connection with this book/series. I listened to this one using the dramatized version from scribd . I’m not sure if the dramatization added anything for me, but I’m not giving up yet! I’ve been informed by several friends that it gets better and the second book is definitely better than the first. I’m going to give the second book a try in the near future. 

⭐️⭐️⭐️

I had already decided to start the new year off with reading this one, little did I know it would fulfill two different challenges. This vibrant red cover fulfills this month’s prompt for #litfor2023 - read a book with a red cover and also fulfills this month’s prompt for #MrDReads2023 - read a book you meant to read in 2022. This book/series has been on my TBR for all of 2022 and I continuously passed over it so I decided to start 2023 with it.

Mit Rosa Zambrano tritt eine neue Ermittlerin in Erscheinung. Ihr erster Fall ist bereits eine Herausforderung, denn der Tote ist Dr. Jansen und der ist ausgerechnet ihr Gynäkologe, bei dem sie erst vor kurzem Eizellen einfrieren ließ. Die Spurensuche führt Rosa nicht nur in seine Praxis, sondern auch in Genforschungslabore, ins Rotlichtmilieu und in die alternative Szene. 

Spannende Themen für einen Krimi, doch irgendwie konnte mich die Umsetzung nicht vollständig überzeugen. Warum ist das so? Für mich standen die wirklich interessanten Beschreibungen Zürichs und das Privatleben Rosas zu sehr im Fokus der Geschichte. 

Normalerweise lese ich gerne Krimis, die auch das Privatleben der Ermittler beleuchten, aber hier sind mir die Krimielemente doch etwas zu kurz gekommen. Ich habe vergebens auf überraschende Wendungen gewartet, die für mich zu einem spannenden Krimi dazugehören. Dafür fand ich die detaillierten Ausführungen zur Gentechnik und den damit verbundenen Gefahren sehr informativ zu lesen. 

Alles in allem erlebte ich mit der sympathischen Rosa eine schöne Zeit in Zürich jenseits der Touristenströme. Nur der Nervenkitzel, den ich sonst bei Krimis verspüre, wollte sich nicht so richtig einstellen.

🎥 Book Review 🎥 

Nora Goes Off Script by Annabel Monaghan 
Pub Date 06/07/2022 
(Swipe for synopsis.)

**Thank you NetGalley and Penguin Group Putnam for this eARC in exchange for an honest review.**

I really enjoyed the idea of the romance writer playing out the romance storyline format. This was the best part of this book. 

The rest of it, I wasn’t very fond of. I’ve seen nothing but great reviews for this one, but it just didn’t work for me. 

Do you have any Booksta favorites that didn’t work for you? 

**SPOILERS BELOW** Proceed with caution! 😉

.

.
.
 
When the first “I love you” comes it is in text without any other precursory comments or conversations. Nora automatically calls Leo her boyfriend without them having any type of conversation signifying that’s what kind of relationship they are in. Those were just a couple things that came across as weird to me.

The “as if” comments from Nora are annoying. I didn’t feel like they really fit her character overall. 

The proposal is tacky as hell! 🙄 

The miscommunication revolving around a lie is forgivable since it stems from a kid, but it makes the poor communication between the adults that much more stupid. 
 
I normally enjoy the celebrity and “normal person” trope, but I was overly annoyed at how out of touch with everyday life Leo was. 

Overall my biggest gripe is the pacing issues. Due to the book being so short, the romance and 3rd act spiral happened too quickly without much development. 

I really wanted to love this one, but it just didn’t work for me.

18013308307509376;"BOOK REVIEW: Bear Town by Frederik Backman
🐻‍❄
Unpopular Opinion: I found this book to be full of clichéd characters and a wanna-be depth. I know this novel is very popular on Bookstagram, and I was so excited to finally read it. I was not bored, but I was disappointed.
🐻‍❄
The first page was promising. I was excited to read about the small town that's only source of pride and unity is hockey. I love winter-themed books, and although I'm not a hockey fan, ironically, the dynamics of the hockey team and the politics surrounding it were the plot details that I found most interesting. The rest of the novel left a lot to be desired. I absolutely hated the dialog, especially between the parents and their children and between spouses; it was cheesy and unnatural. The characters are also extremely stereotypical- the rich, spoiled jock whose dad never gave him enough attention, the bad boy with a secret the underdog, the workaholic mom judged for not being a stay-at-home housewife, the coach obsessed with winning, the coach who cares more about the team’s well-being, the brave, innocent girl who' hated by the town for speaking up after being violated. It reads like a morality tale/after-school special.  I also became annoyed with the omniscient narrator, who constantly repeated the same phrases over and over and over while providing commentary on the town. Oh, and the novel takes place in Sweden, but I would’ve NEVER known except for the reference to Swedish currency. I wanted more descriptive details about the wintery town that was buried within a forest of Sweden.
🐻‍❄
Believe it or not, I'm willing to read another novel by Backman, because he is so popular, and I did read in a bunch of Bear Town reviews that his writing is very different in some of his other novels.

Happy February my anxious girlies!! My fingers are crossed that this month goes by faster than January did because 🫠

some of the books I’m hoping to read this month are:
✨Love on The Brain (our book club pick this month)
✨Final Offer
✨Jasper Vale
✨House of Earth and Blood
✨Queen of Myth and Monsters
✨Things We Hide From The Light
there’s more.. but these are at the tippy top! and truthfully, I might read something totally different because.. well I read whatever my heart tells me to😅

I am giving this one 3 stars because of some reasons. The narration bored me and the world building was a bit meh. For me this turned out to be over hyped by booktok. I wish the plot gets better in the next books because I thought of discovering whats all this hype about. :-) 

No hard feelings though cuz different people love different tastes. <3

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Read this book if you like:
🫶second chance romance
👫childhood friends to lovers romance
✨dual POV
🎢Disney World 
🤍The Fine Print/Terms & Conditions

What I loved:
EVERYTHING🥹 okay but for real, this is my absolute favourite book out of all three Dreamland books. I think we see the most growth from Cal compared to Declan and Rowan, and we get to meet Lana and Cami and they’re such great characters! Lauren did an incredible job with addressing Cal’s addiction struggles - it’s some of the best writing of a character with addiction that I’ve read. Truly this series was PHENOMENAL, and the third book was a fave. 

What I didn’t love:
In the beginning I was a little scared because this book is almost 600 pages, and for a romance that is A LOT, in my opinion. But I am so glad that Lauren gave us every single page, they are all worth it. 

Did this book live up to the hype for you?! Lemme know your thoughts🤍";2023-02-13 14:29:19+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:53.268455+00:00;10;70;en

📌Reseña en colaboración con plazayjanes 

Cosas que sí ☺️

🍁 Narración en primera persona desde el punto de vista de Jasmine, la prota.

🍁 El mundo del patinaje artístico sobre hielo me fascina. En este libro es un claro protagonista, todo gira en torno a ello.

🍁 La parte de enemies to lovers me ha gustado bastante, había mucha tensión.

🍁 Visibilidad de temas sensibles.

🍁 Me ha gustado mucho la pluma de la autora.

Cosas que no 😬

🍂 Capítulos MUY, pero que MUY largos, que me han sacado de la lectura y me sentía agotada con tan solo leerme un capítulo.

🍂 Hay varios comentarios sobre el físico y alguna que otra actitud (🚩total) que no me han gustado nada.

🍂 La actitud de los protas no refleja la edad que tienen, parecían adolescentes y tienen 26 y 30 años.

🍂 La trama se me ha quedado plana y previsible y en este caso, una vez más, el hype me ha jugado una mala pasada.

🍂 Pasa por alto y de una manera muy frívola temas sensibles, así como no llamar a las cosas por su nombre.

🍂 La actitud de ellos ha llegado a saturarme, es MUY slow burn, para mi gusto demasiado. 

🍂 Tampoco llegamos a conocer a Ivan ni su mundo, me he quedado con ganas de capítulos narrados por el.

Instagram is constantly inspiring us to get uncomfortable and grow - which is awesome. But personally I find that ALWAYS being in a growth mode can be exhausting, anxiety-provoking and depleting. It has me focused on the future all of the time and doesn’t allow me to stop and look around and enjoy the present as much. And if we can’t ever enjoy it then what is even the point? 🤷‍♀️

It’s ok to stop and be proud of what you’ve achieved and celebrate it awhile. You can stay there and maintain it. You can do whatever you want or do nothing further at all. Doesn’t mean you’re lazy, unmotivated, or “don’t want it bad enough” 🙄

GOTTA
ooof, this book was Really NOT That Good, Actually

Guys, I'm so sorry but it just didn't do it for me.
I don't know if it's because the autofiction style didn't work with this particular story or the miserable way we were forced to endure a storytelling that could and should have been half the length, but it was painfully average.

You know that story that we have all heard where someone goes through a divorce or death of their partner and proceeds not to brush their teeth, then becomes a really shitty friend to their friends, then struggles to process why their self-absorbed take on life has pushed everyone away?...Yeah, it's just a re-telling of that.

Not to take away from the genuine pain that the MC was feeling or to judge the way she dealt with the divorce (let's be clear, my annoyance isn't at the things she did... I have no horse on which to sit atop and look down my nose). 
The story itself was just so...nothing. I was promised a compelling, funny, heartfelt read and instead, found myself huffing and sighing and rolling my eyes at the forced cliché of it all. 

We get talked at for what felt like ""eighteen pages FRONT AND BACK!!"" (for those not old enough to get the reference...it dragged unnecessarily) and rather than it feel relatable, I just had second-hand embarrassment and huge bouts of annoyance. 

To be clear, I didn't hate it but I really didn't love it and while waiting for it to improve- I finished it😵‍💫😬😅.
I really expected a lot of humour - just because of how it had been marketed. In truth, I think it's one that's been written FOR other divorcees who have been through it and can relate to moments where they've maybe not been their best selves as a result?

It read like the ramblings of an emotionally immature woman and I think publishers have done a really good job in tricking readers into thinking this was going to be super impactful...I will have forgotten it by next week.

Really glad I listened to this on scribd and didn't waste the money... who knew my book buying ban would save me in this way!?? 😂👌🏾

Ni que experimentar con comida pudiera matarte! Menos si está supervisado por un nutricionista. 

Cuando la ciencia estudia a los humanos va bien bien lento! Es así! Hacer estudios en humanos que tengan validez científica, no es fácil. Además de diseñarlos bien, tienen que ser éticos. 

Partiendo de este punto, la mayoría de mis pacientes viven en una ciudad, trabajan a veces más de lo que deberían, muchos no hacen actividad física, muchos no obtienen sueño reparador… tomando en cuenta esto, eliminar el gluten es una de las pocas cosas que podemos hacer fácilmente, que nos reportan algún tipo de beneficio sistémico. Quizás en la mayoría de los casos, el gluten no es la causa de ningún problema de salud, pero quitarlo como ayuda! 

Considerando que otros cambios que ayudarían mucho a veces no se pueden lograr (dormir mas y mejor, hacer ejercicio, trabajar menos), nadie nunca se murió por quitar el gluten y tampoco pueden decirme que no lo quitaron “porque no tienen tiempo”. 

Ignorar el método científico es un error garrafal cuando se trata de MEDICINA, pero creo que es bastante inocuo basarse en teoría cuando se trata de nutrición. 

La teoría existe. Quizás en la prueba práctica todavía no hay consenso. Pero quien necesita consenso en nutrición cuando cada cuerpo es distinto? 

Abro debate.

Anzeige 

Wie oft mir dieser Satz in der Vergangenheit begegnet ist - ich konnte irgendwann nicht mehr mit zählen. So viele Menschen nutzen diese Ausrede um ihre Hunde nicht erziehen zu müssen, oder um gewisse Defizite damit zu entschuldigen. Wie ihr wisst, waren wir relativ lange im Rally Obedience aktiv. Gerade da ist mir der Satz oft untergekommen und er stößt bei mir auf absolutes Unverständnis. Ein Hund kann - egal welcher Herkunft - so viel lernen, wenn es mit liebevoller Konsequenz gemacht wird. Natürlich ist der Aufwand von Rasse zu Rasse verschieden, das möchte ich auch gar nicht bestreiten. Dennoch ist die Aussage für mich kein Hinweis, dass ein Hund etwas nicht lernen könnte - Aufgrund seiner Herkunft. Eher Aufgrund mangelnder Motivation der Besitzer. 

Was denkt ihr, woher die Ausrede kommt? 

Ich habe diesbezüglich eine #unpopularopinion : und zwar glaube ich, dass unter den Besitzern die Anzahl von Personen die 1. Mitleid mit dem Hund haben und deswegen 2. oftmals Erziehung nicht so streng nehmen, besonders hoch ist. 

Na? Was denkst du? Ich freue mich auf einen respektvollen Meinungs- und Erfahrungsaustausch!

Things We Never Got Over // Lucy Score 
⭐️⭐️

Okay, what on earth was that?

As usual, these reviews are my opinion and based on GoodReads, the average rating for this book is 4.2 so I’m in the minority.

This book is incredibly too long for what it is. The smut scenes are cringey and I can’t believe they were actually written by a woman. Read the following highlights with caution.

“Professional ruiner of vaginas”

“I closed so tight around his fingers I worried he was going to need an X-ray”

“You keep milking my dick like that, sweetheart”

There are so many more sentences that are just like… what? I stuck around because these scenes were around the halfway point and if anything I was actually intrigued by the evil twin plot. So I can’t give it just a single star rating.

Me & Khary 21-22 years ago when all we had was our youth, hopes, dreams, room for mistakes & time‼️🥰🥰Life wasn’t “life-ing” back then for us. Life was just a big ball of fun for us!!! 🤣🤣

Here’s my #UnpopularOpinion about marriage:

2️⃣You MUST be “committed to the commitment” of marriage!!!
3️⃣Marriage is just as much…if not MORE…about “duty & obligation” than it is “love.”

17957777180271337;"🔸Here's an unpopular travel opinion: You can be a maximalist. 

Whenever I have to pack, I pack a lot more than I need. I know that there are tons of clothing items I probably won't wear because I packed 10 dresses for three days. I always think to myself ""What if I need it? What if I feel like wearing it?"", and end up packing a luggage double the size of what other people would. 

I'm getting better at picking things. I'm getting better at leaving things behind. But hell no, I'm not a minimalist. I will always pack something unnecessary just because it's funny or cute. I will also always pack the things that people don't consider as needs that almost always turns out the opposite. I won't ask for help because I can't carry it, I won't be whining, if my luggage is over the weight limit, I won't act out. I know my habits and I feel safer this way. And I got other's backs, too 😉

So, instead of making tasteless jokes like ""Are you moving? Is there a dead body in there?"" or instead of judging, you can appreciate maximalists/extra packers since they'd probably have what you need somewhere in their bag.

Mir hat die Geschichte trotz der spannenden Erzählform jedoch nicht gefallen. Denn die Denkprozesse des Hauptprotagonisten konnte ich nicht nachvollziehen und aus diesem Grund hat mich die Handlung nicht berührt.

Olive practically forced herself on Jason while being wasted? There were so many things wrong with what was happening there. Really, what even is that scene?!?! 
Olive’s ‘’friends’’ absolutely sucked, there were so many random unnecessary things happening and the writing/smut/romance just made me cringe. The only person I liked was Lucy, and then her love interest changes in the sequel!!

.

Es ist hier ein bißchen ruhiger als vorher. Weil ich Abstand brauche. Von fast allem hier. Vielleicht sage ich gleich zu Beginn schon mal, dass das hier MEINE Empfindung ist. Ihr könnt das alles anders sehen, total ok. Für mich jedenfalls war Instagram in den letzten Monaten vor allem zum Augenrollen. Weil es sich andauernd und immer und ununterbrochen um Anstrengung dreht. In Posts und Stories wird das Leben als einzige Hechelpartie und - nochmal - Anstrengung dargestellt. Dieses Thema wird dann in zig Posts über Wochen solange verarbeitet, bis ich schreien möchte: „Jaaaa, ok! Ich hab‘s ja jetzt kapiert!!“

Auf die Gefahr hin, dass ich mir jetzt den Unmut vieler zuziehe: ich verstehe, weshalb darüber so viel geschrieben wird. Klar, diese Themen brauchen Awareness. Aber: vom ewigen Lamentieren wird‘s nicht besser. Es kann nur besser werden, wenn konkrete Lösungsansätze gesucht werden. Und die können nur von denen gesucht werden, die betroffen sind, weil sie wissen, was sie brauchen. Und weil - seien wir doch mal ehrlich - Lösungsvorschläge von Nichtbetroffenen sowieso immer in der Luft zerrissen werden.

Als food for thought: andauernd klagend über Ungerechtigkeiten und Anstrengung zu berichten, sich dann aber gleichzeitig über Mitleid zu beschweren, das hat was von „wasch mich, aber mach mich nicht nass.“

Enríquez cuenta la historia de la Orden: una secta formada por familias poderosas, millonarias y con influencias que buscan la inmortalidad a través de la comunicación con su dios, la Oscuridad 🖤. Para lograr esa comunicación necesitan de personas médium que sean capaces de invocar y conectar con su dios. Gaspar está destinado a sustituir al último médium, su padre Juan, pero este hará todo lo posible para evitarlo. 

Una historia muy turbia, violenta y macabra. Escrita con saltos en el tiempo y desde las voces de diferentes personajes.  Realmente quería que me gustara. Quería ser de esas personas a las que le fascina esta novela pero, no, no ha sido el caso. Entrar en la historia se me hizo muy cuesta arriba, las 100 primeras páginas no invitan a seguir. Después, el personaje de Gaspar hace que te enganches a su historia, pero otra vez decae y se hace bola hasta la página 667.  Se que puede ser una #unpopularopinion pero de verdad que me ha costado mucho terminarlo. 

Quiero pensar que quizá debería haber comenzado por los relatos de la autora en lugar de su novela. 

¿Qué me recomendáis que lea de #MarianaEnriquez?

Well guess what, it isn't messy, if you start it in release order. Of course you won't kbow what is going on, when you begin with something mothy wrote in 2021, just because it is chronologically the first.

I know that Stay With Me is a song not a lot of people like because of the tuning, and I get that. I understand how the high notes can be really ear-grating. But, for some reason, I actually really like it, and it’s one of my favourite Meiko songs. I really like low-range Meiko, but something about Stay With Me is just really enjoyable for me.

 3/5 ⭐️

Avastasin paar päeva tagasi, et päris palju on sellest raamatust bookstagramis juttu ja hakkasin siis vaatama, et mis ma sellest kirjutasin. Nii avastasingi endale suureks üllatuseks, et ma pole midagi sellest kirjutanud 😀

Mäletan, et jõulude ajal haarasin selle Apollost kaasa, sest kaanekujundus kuidagi tõmbas ja meeldis. Kahjuks minu #unpopularopinion on, et lugu ise oli kuidagi veider ja ei haaranud mind endasse. 🙃

On mul veel mõttekaaslasi selles osas või jättis see ainult minu külmaks? 🤔

⭐️⭐️⭐️💫

Please don’t come after me for not rating this 5 stars 😅😂

I read this with a bunch of people in sunshine.bookclub ! This was my first Emily Henry book! I was beyond excited to receive an advanced copy in exchange for an honest review! Thank you so much penguinrandomca !

Book Lovers is a slow burn enemies to lovers meet-cute story about Nora Stephens, a literary agent, and Charlie Lastra, a book editor. I really enjoyed all the banter and the book talk but unfortunately found the two main characters very unlikable and flat. The love interest felt so forced and I found myself yawning throughout the book, waiting for something to peak my interest. I honestly enjoyed the side story about Nora's sister, Libby, much more and found her to be way more of a dimensional and down-to-earth character compared to the others. 🤷🏻‍♀️

It seems like all of Emily Henry's books have super mixed reviews. I recently read Beach Read as part of a buddy read and wasn’t blown away by that one either, but I am definitely still curious about reading 'People We Meet On Vacation' sometime this summer!

In the world of sentience there is no difference between a dog, a cat, a cow, a chicken or a pig. Moments of joy, pain, fear and even grief aren’t exclusive to dogs and cats, all animals have an emotional world of their own.

Wszyscy czytali, wszyscy się bali, wszyscy chwalili... Ile ja się nasłuchałam, że jest rewelacyjny, zaskakujący i przerażający, a spać to po nim na pewno nie będę... Ugh, może momentami faktycznie trwałam w napięciu, bo chciałam w końcu poznać rozwiązanie całej sprawy, ale serio - nic mnie tu nie zaskoczyło, a tym bardziej nie przestraszyło.

I really don’t. I know a lot of sober folks do, I’ve seen them here on Instagram, and met many sho share the sentiment in real life too. 

Do I agree that there is stigma and shame attached to the sobriety/recovery/AF community… 100% 

Do I believe that society plays a huge role in normalizing drunkenness and over-consumption of alcohol… 100% 

Do I think that it’s never a bad thing to not drink… 100% 

Do I have a problem with people who can drink “normally” and do so… NOPE 

I have nothing against those who do hate alcohol, I just don’t have it in me. 

If being able to point a finger and blame something gives you closure, if raging against “Big Alcohol” keeps you motivated, if  making alcohol a social pariah help keeps you excited about your own sobriety then I am here for it!! 

For me, “big alcohol”, social constructs around alcohol, and alcohol in and of itself illicits no strong feelings for me in sobriety. 

I just really don’t care about it anymore ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

If you need to hate it, if you still need to be angry at alcohol then that’s cool too.

Über ihr Leben, ihre sieben Ehemänner und vor allem die Frage aller Fragen - wer war denn nun ihre große Liebe? Ausgesucht hat sie sich für die Beichte ausgerechnet eine völlig unbekannte Autorin des AVANT-Magazins, nur mit Monique Grant möchte sie sprechen, nur ihr die größten Geheimnisse ihrer Biografie anvertrauen. Doch was steckt wirklich dahinter und kann Evelyn mit der Wahrheit über ihre Vergangenheit vielleicht viel mehr als nur ihre eigene Geschichte erzählen? 

So, ich hab Evelyn Hugo, das Buch, über das ganz Bookstagram spricht, nun auch endlich gelesen und joa, es ist ein netter Schmöker, aber mehr leider auch nicht. Während Daisy Jones mich letztes Jahr im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes umgehauen und elektrisiert hat, kann ich für Evelyn Hugo nur ein etwas müdes Lächeln aufbringen. Weder konnten die Figuren mich großartig für sich einnehmen (wie es bei Daisy absolut der Fall war, was hab ich mitgefiebert, gelacht und geweint), noch finde ich die Geschichte trotz kleiner Überraschungen und Wendungen wahnsinnig originell. Dazu ist die Übersetzung von Babette Schröder leider ziemlich ungelenk, ich bin manches Mal im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes über einen merkwürdigen Satzbau gestolpert. Definitiv nicht mein Buch, mein Genre, und ich glaube, ich lasse es in Zukunft auch darauf beruhen - und erfreue mich einfach an meinen Erinnerungen an die wunderbare Daisy Jones!

⭐️⭐️⭐️.5/5

I’m going to do my best for no spoilers! But it’s the fifth book in the series, so beware!

I have mixed feelings about this one. But here’s the good: NESTA. My queen. A true bad B. 👸🏼I LOVE HER. And her friendship with Emerie and Gwyn! The Blood Rite was dope. And I really appreciated the mental health aspect of this book.

But a couple (sorta major) things I didn’t love: Nesta and Cassian’s relationship?! 🥴 don’t come for me!! It was SO over-sexualized. If you’re reading this book for the smut, it definitely delivered! But I guess I was hoping for more of, idk, a plot?! Lol. This book was VERY lacking in that department, especially considering how long it was. Too long and too little actually happening. By the end, I just wanted the book to be over. 

Overall, I was disappointed. It was a weak installment in the series (imo), which made me sad because Nesta is a new favorite character. She deserves the best 🥲";2022-05-23 13:12:15+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:57.201214+00:00;28;0;en

❗Que te amenacen con unas tijeras en la garganta, que te tiren al suelo y a la piscina, que te humillen todo el rato...eso es muy sexy y romántico, si 🤨
❗ Insultos por doquier. Zorra, perdedor, estúpida zorra... De ese estilo. ¡Qué romántico y sano!
❗Los dos personajes son horribles pero RYEN es VOMITIVA. Una persona como ella tendría que estar en un correccional o un psiquiatra mínimo. Ambos son ultra tóxicos 

🥀Los valores que transmite este libro es que tienes ser un acosador/a para triunfar, tratar mal a todo el mundo y tener una relación prácticamente sexual violenta, llegando al abuso verbal y físico. Todo maravilloso 🤔

Por supuesto, puedes leer el libro y disfrutarlo. No digo que no. Pero tienes que entender que esto NO está bien, esto NO es sano, esto NO es amor y si estás en una situación así, por favor. Sal de ahí. Ya mismo. Ya sabemos cómo acaba todo esto verdad? Lo vemos a diario en las noticias,por desgracia. 🌹Disfruta del libro con cabeza, no podemos idealizar estas relaciones. Y por supuesto, este libro NO es juvenil. Tened cuidado en regalarlo o  recomendarlo. Por favor. No cuesta nada informarse🙌

Por todo esto, para MI, es un libro BASURA. Entiendo que guste y que entretenga, de verdad que lo hago. Y lo respeto. Pero para mí es un NO

Have you ever purchased a book based solely on its cover? 

I purchased the first book in this series, Practical Magic, based on its cover. It’s a cute cover with the boot, you might have seen it. These two covers, however, would never have sold me. 🙈😆 

♡ The Rules of Magic ~ I loved the stories of Franny, Jet, and Vincent. Their stories of love were all so unique and their love for each other was beautiful. In this book we continued following the Owens’ curse from Maria Owens. The curse is that an Owens can never love because nothing good ever comes from loving someone, someone always gets hurt from loving them. I loved their journeys of love through the curse and how they found themselves. Really a beautiful sequel to Practical Magic! 🪄

♡ Magic Lessons ~ This book did not follow up well. This was supposed to be THE book, the one that we find out all about Maria Owens, the originator of the Owens curse. I was so bored and it fell more than flat for me. 2/3 of the book went like this.. “Maria knows she’s not supposed to do this. All the omens of something bad are here and.. she does it anyways.” This book made me feel like women can be counted on to do stupid things especially when it comes to love. An entire book based on the stupidity of women and I WAS. NOT. HERE. FOR. IT. 

I have the next book The Book of Magic and I’m hoping it’s as amazing as the first two! 🙌🏼

17867468582868788;"Dům v blankytně modrém moři vypráví o sociálním pracovníkovi Linusovi, který se vydává  do sirotčince s šesti magickými dětmi, které mají zvlášť nebezpečné schopnosti, prověřit, zda funguje správně. Brzy ale začne přicházet na to, že tahle zdánlivě rutinní práce ho možná naučí víc, než si kdy dokázal představit.

Dům obletěl IG a vybudovala si obrovský hype, všichni ho milují a doporučují. A já naprosto chápu proč. Je plný krásných myšlenek, dojemných pasáží a hřejivé atmosféry. Mluví o změně pohledu na svět, o tom, že každý člověk v každém věku může najít štěstí, že domov nemusí být jen místo, ale i lidi. O tom, že společnost mnohdy neumí přijímat ty, kdo jsou jiní, a že právě v naší jinakosti se skrývá krása. To všechno dělá a má za to můj velký obdiv. Na druhou stranu, děje v ní moc nenajdete a paradoxně bych očekávala i o něco víc propracované postavy. Některé pasáže mi přišly přitažené za vlasy a spousta myšlenek byla sice krásná a dojemná, ale podaná hrozně na sílu a okatě, jako by vám autor při čtení koukal přes rameno a říkal: „Teď máš začít brečet!“ nebo „Podívej se, jak ohromně je tohle hluboký.“

Plus je tu ještě jedna věc, která mi vadila, a to podporování stigmatu točícího se okolo sociálních pracovníků. Jakožto student tohoto oboru vím víc než dobře, že si lidi při spojení „sociální pracovník“ často vybaví zlou čarodějnici. Jasně, někdy to tak třeba opravdu je. Jenže tak je to u každé profese. A ve většině případů jde čistě jen o stigma, které způsobuje problémy, komplikuje práci a ani zdaleka není univerzálně pravdivé. Rozhodně ho nemůžete vztáhnout na každého pracovníka a to, jak tohle celé Klune zpracoval (že se v celé knize nevyskytuje jediný „hodný“ sociální pracovník a že Linus v té profesi vlastně strašně trpí) mi opravdu velkou radost neudělalo. Je skvělé, že boří stigma ohledně LGBTQ+ komunity a lidí, kteří nezapadají, ale ještě lepší by bylo, kdyby u toho nepodporoval jiné.

Takže ne, nemyslím si, že Dům je tak dokonalá kniha, jak všichni tvrdí. Zároveň ale nechci říct, že je špatný, vůbec ne. A pokud vás zaujal a nevadí vám absence děje, s radostí vám ho doporučím. Ale některé věci se daly uchopit líp.

Let me start off by saying this: if you need to make a list of the characters in your novel at the beginning for readers to reference as they go, you either have too many characters in your story or you haven’t fleshed them out enough to make them unique and impressionable.

Okay. End rant on 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵. Onto my review:

This book was a letdown for me, from start to finish. While the writing itself was clean and digestible, this story was… well, boring and predictable.

The setting for the story had so much potential, but with unlikeable characters that you don’t even learn enough about to be able to relate to, and plot twists that are way too easily guessed before anything even happens, you’re left with a story that just isn’t very fun to read.

Ruth Ware is always very hit or miss, and this Agatha Christie-esque whodunnit was very much a miss for me. I was determined to finish, hoping it would get better. But, unfortunately, the ridiculous ending may have been even worse than the slow beginning 😅 

𝐒𝐮𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐲:
Getting snowed in at a mountain chalet doesn't sound like the worst problem in the world, especially when there's a breathtaking vista, a cozy fire, and company to keep you warm. But what happens when that company is eight of your coworkers and you can't trust any of them? When a company retreat goes utterly wrong when an avalanche hits, the corporate food chain becomes irrelevant and survival trumps togetherness. Come Monday morning, how many members short will the team be?

𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲:
This was solid writing, and I did stay invested long enough to finish it instead of giving up, but overall it just wasn’t a book I’d recommend to others. Perhaps the ~only~ part that I found interesting was the part where I was guessing who the murderer would kill next 🙃

For me it's The Song of Achilles (please don't hate me 🙈). 
In my opinion it was kinda boring. I like Greek mythology, so that was the best part of it. The ending was unspectacular, it didn't move me at all. I've heard of so many people crying for days after they finished it and somehow it didn't even take me a day before I started a new book. 
I think the story had potential, but for me it was way too fast paced, so I couldn't empathize with the characters. Maybe if the book had been longer or a duology, I might have liked it. 

💫 Did you like The Song of Achilles? What did (or didn't) you like about it? 💫

Für mich ist es The Song of Achilles bzw. Das Lied des Achill (bitte hasst mich nicht 🙈). 
Meiner Meinung nach war es irgendwie langweilig. Ich mag die griechische Mythologie, das war also der beste Part an allem. Auch das Ende war unspektakulär, es hat mich kein bisschen berührt. Ich habe von so vielen Leuten gehört, die noch tagelang geweint haben, nachdem sie das Buch beendet haben, aber ich hab nicht mal einen Tag gebraucht, bevor ich ein neues Buch angefangen habe. 
Ich denke, die Geschichte hatte Potenzial, aber für mich war es einfach viel zu fast paced, deswegen konnte ich mich nicht in die Charaktere hineinversetzen. Wenn das Buch länger oder eine Dilogie gewesen wäre, hätte ich es vielleicht gemocht.

⭐️/ 5

I am sorry, guys, but this ranks among the worst books I've read this year. 

This was my third and probably final book I will ever read from Colleen Hoover. 

I applaud anyone who is trying to get into any kind of hobby, including writing and I know this was her first attempt at a thriller, but the only thing she accomplished with it, was to strengthen my belief that I will never like her work. 

The mental gymnastics that this book is putting you through just solidifies even more how bad of a writer she is. This is, at best, the screenplay for a poorly written Lifetime-esque movie. 

If you are looking for a good thriller, look somewhere else cause this ain't it!

*Premise as seen on Goodreads:*
Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.

Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.

Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.";2022-12-30 22:50:33+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:57.216728+00:00;6;0;en
17894045987751675;"Nomadland is a 2020 American drama film written, produced, edited and directed by Chloé Zhao. Based on the 2017 nonfiction book Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century. 🍿

Plot: A woman in her sixties, after losing everything in the Great Recession, embarks on a journey through the American West, living as a van-dwelling modern-day nomad. 🎬

Great Recession was a period of marked general decline and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded that it was the most severe economic and financial meltdown since the Great Depression. The causes of the Great Recession include a combination of vulnerabilities that developed in the financial system, along with a series of triggering events that began with the bursting of the United States housing bubble in 2005–2012. 

For me the film is one-time-watch, due to its drama and grief. It describes the pain that caused the Great Recession in 2007-2009 in the U.S and how people managed to overcome their difficulties. It follows #francesmcdormand as Fern, a woman who lost her house and job and therefore she had nothing but a van to live in. The cinematography is beautiful and it travels us to a lot of different places, with a lot of different people. However, Fern still feels lonely without having a real friend to rely on.

My opinion about it, and maybe it's an unpopular one, is that the film's perspective is to show us the poverty and the devastation of those people through Fern's eyes. Even though the film is trying to be realistic to the audience, those people's feelings, the grief, the sadness, the sorrow can't be described in a realistic way if you haven't been a part of it. Those feelings can be described only through an actress's eyes and through a film that can show the unrealistic, in my opinion, perspective of the happy and entertaining life a homeless and jobless nomad can have!

The movie won 3 Oscars awards: Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role: Frances McDormand, Best Achievement in Directing: Chloé Zhao.

What are your thoughts about the film? 🤔";2023-01-17 16:14:37+00:00;2023-03-27 14:36:57.216728+00:00;6;206;en

These books were not it chief. The hype was just a bit to big in my opinion. Each one has something different that just didn’t mesh with me. Some I felt had no plot and could’ve been way shorter. A couple I found the female main character so annoying. One of these I was down right frustrated with and wanted to throw across the room. My mother was sick of me ranting to her about it. Honestly still mad about that book. The only one I DNFed was Song of Achilles. 

These are my own opinions! If you loved any of these books please don’t take offense! The best part about reading is that we can all read the same words on the pages but have different feelings and reactions! ✨

I was super excited to read this book as it was hyped but but let me tell you, it didn't meet my expectations at all. I must say the story is different, the character with my protagonist being a maid but ending was predictable. I would say there were more details of cleanliness and hotel management than the mystery part. The main character Molly the maid was more chill and in her own world thinking about her grandma and what she would say in that situation. Grandma's quotes were more mentioned than the twists and turns. 

The story is about Molly maid who was working as cleaner in famous hotel. She was happy with her work and enjoying it till one day, she found dead body of Mr. Black who was a famous person. Being maid and first one to see that made her accused of murder. Now with this starts Molly's police station visits, answering detective's questions and being arrested for the same. But someone close to her was plotting a game against her which she was unaware. Will she prove herself innocent?? Will anyone help her?? Read book to know more. 

After reading few chapters, I was sure who was the murderer. The mystery was predictable and I think it's more about fictional work on Molly life than murder mystery. I am quite disappointed with it.

Yo leí este libro con muchísimo hype, tenia entendido que era una relación preciosa con un amor de lo más sano y sinceramente a mi me dio la sensación de ser todo lo contrario, no llegué a ver la relación de amor en ninguna parte y el prota masculino me pareció un poco tóxico. A la gente que si os gustó, me encantaría saber vuestra opinión y que os ha gustado más del libro, yo siendo sincera, el principio del libro me gustó, pero a partir de la parte de Ibiza, es cuando empezó a decaer un montón.

As personagens femininas são interessantes e gostei que quisessem retratar a dificuldade de uma mulher nos anos 60, principalmente no ramo da ciência. Só que os discursos feministas da personagem principal (Elizabeth Zoth) pareceram-me muito forçados e que não foram simplesmente inseridos na história. Não consegui criar conexão com ela, até me apeguei mais às personagens secundárias. 

Foi a minha primeira desilusão do ano... e que desilusão! Achava que ia ser um favorito. Não deixo de achar um livro ""bom"" para um romance de estreia. Mas faltou tanta coisa... 

Qual foi o último livro que vos desiludiu? 🥰

🗝 𝙴𝚕 𝚎𝚗𝚒𝚐𝚖𝚊 𝚍𝚎 𝚕𝚊 𝚑𝚊𝚋𝚒𝚝𝚊𝚌𝚒𝚘𝚗 𝟼𝟸𝟸 - Joël Dicker

Se viene unpopular opinion y os adelanto que esta me duele incluso a mí. Porque 𝗮𝗱𝗼𝗿𝗼 la pluma de Dicker y soy fan de todos sus libros… excepto de este. Y aunque me cuesta mucho decir algo malo sobre este autor, tengo que ser sincera.

El enigma de la habitación 622 ha sido una de mis grandes decepciones de los últimos años, no sé si por las expectativas, que estaban muy altas o porque no era mi momento para leerlo, el caso es que acabar este libro fue un suplicio para mí y el único motivo por el que lo hice fue porque era Dicker y esperaba que al final terminase gustándome.

No ocurrió. Incluso llegué a plantearme varias veces que no lo hubiese escrito el autor, no había ningún elemento que me hiciese pensar que estaba leyendo un libro de Dicker, luego pensé que era cosa de la traducción pero el traductor era el mismo… me esforcé por encontrar algún motivo, cuando el único motivo era que simplemente el libro me parecía malo (a mí, no se ofenda nadie, siempre es perspectiva personal).

👉 Los personajes me parecieron infantiles e insufribles. 
👉 El misterio tarda en plantearse más de la mitad del libro.
👉 Los saltos en el tiempo eran caóticos.
👉 Las subtramas me resultaron sumamente aburridas.

En resumen, tenia las expectativas muy altas y el batacazo que me lleve fue monumental. Pero espero quitarme la espinita con su nueva obra, que se presenta la semana que viene y ¿adivináis quien va a ir a la firma? 🙋🏻‍♀️

Perdóname Joël, porque te adoro, pero me puede la sinceridad 🙊 ¿a vosotros os gustó? ¿Cuál es vuestro favorito del autor?

17967374189281509;"The ones that put off getting help will be the ones who suffer

This might be an unpopular opinion but here goes...

We are mostly responsible for our own suffering

It's a conscious decision in our thought process to suffer

NOTE: We are not getting into deep conversations over illness or worldwide issues here

What we are referring to is when people put off getting help for

Burnout
To improve their health
Change their current situation

I am exhausted I'll get help WHEN
I have this job to do I'll get help WHEN
Things are really busy WHEN it quietens down I'll reach out

Another word for suffering is ""Tolerate""

What is it you are willing to tolerate in your life?

Sickness?
Exhaustion?
Depression?
Resentment?
Detachment?

We have news for you

The time will never be right
There will never be a quiet time
You will always be exhausted if you don't take action

Set aside the fear of ""what if it does not work""
Set aside the judgement that you are weak
Set aside the fear of spending money on yourself
and defiantly set aside the fear of it will be more work

What are you willing to tolerate?
How much longer will you put yourself through suffering?

As we said this might not be a popular opinion and might ruffle some of your feathers

If that is so...GOOD... sometimes we need a strong hand to lead us

Even if that means being compassionately ruthless from time to time

We just know what you are truly capable of and you just need to get out of your own way

⭐️⭐️⭐️ 3.5 

After loving book one, I was looking forward to continuing with this series. Let me start off by saying Allister had my full attention 😍 but if I'm being honest, this one just didn't do it for me. I already know this is an unpopular opinion as most reviews found this one better than book one. 🤷‍♀️

I enjoyed the characters and the connections but felt it a bit slow and repetitive at times. I feel like maybe I needed it to have more action and less romance... which is odd for me because I'm all about romance. But unfortunately, at times, I felt bored. 🫣 

Im still going to continue with this series eventually, as I'm still interested, and these men are addicting!

UNPOPULAR OPINION
I love Japanese literature so much that I consider them as my comfort-go-to-read. I love the weird, emotional yet down to our daily life aspects of them. But, it isn't the case in here.

A coffee shop where you can go and relive a past which you want to change a little seems very interesting as a theme but how this theme has been lost in repeating sentences of over-explanation. The blurb actually isn't accurate as I have found this book to be meddling with regret more than reliving the past. Cute trope with charming Japanese magical realism holds the central theme but the whole concept gets wayward in mundane characters with confusingly similar names. Basically, the book was written as a play and turning it into a novel isn't a good idea. It has spoilt the flow of narration while making everything annoying. The book has the premise of emotions but I have found the very ingredient is lacking just because the characters lack the depth of being connected. Moreover, the narrative might have been a little theatrical to the apathetic me.

There are four stories where each had fair premise of getting developed into a beautiful book of anticipation yet being emotional. I have liked the second one, in fact the letter is actually beautiful.

 

Before the Coffee Gets Cold has came with a lot of expectations but to me the coffee was a little tepid! And, I like my coffee hot. Clearly the hype is unrelated to me.

This overly hyped book reminded me of another hyped book which I hated just because of the similarity of forced emotional gulps, The Stationery Shop.

I #buddyread this book with my sister read.to.heal and a  friend; and this was the force which actually mademe finish this book. Looking forward to more #buddyreading sessions with you guys 🤗❤️

PS: by the end of the book I was too famished for a coffee latte and ended up doing a oil pastel artwork.

Zauważyłam, że bardzo bawią Was moje przypały/niewypały, jak wstawiam o nich story 🙈 no to muszę Wam opowiedzieć, jak wyglądał nasz powrót z sesji majówkowej (tak, minął miesiąc xd)

Poszliśmy pieszo kawał drogi do Cytadeli, dużego parku, w którym wiedziałam, że kwitną jeszcze różowe wiśnie. Sporo czasu zeszło nam na dojście tam i zrobienie zdjęć. Wyszliśmy koło 14, bez jedzenia i picia 🙈

Jak zebraliśmy się z powrotem po 18, byliśmy padnięci, głodni i chciało nam się pić. Jak doszliśmy na przystanek, sprawdziłam tramwaj i akurat miał być za kilka minut, ALE mieliśmy też ochotę na frytki belgijskie, więc ustaliliśmy, że jak nie przyjedzie tramwaj to pójdziemy na frytki 🙈😅 Tramwaj nie przyjechał.

No to człapiemy dalej po te frytki. Jako że chciało mi się pić to weszliśmy do żabki, ale akurat nie było nic, co lubię. Potem szukaliśmy tych frytek i okazało się, że je zamknęli 😫😂

Poszliśmy dalej w stronę domu i kolejnego przystanku, a po drodze postanowiliśmy odebrać kawę ze Starbucks za kupon z apki. Niestety kupon zniknął, miał termin ważności🙈

Na pocieszenie chcieliśmy zjeść McFlurry, ale kolejka była TAK długa, że nam się odechciało. Cały powrót do domu zajął nam 1,5 h, czyli dwa razy dłużej 🙈

Na koniec dnia byłam już tak głodna i padnięta, że śmiałam się z tej serii niefortunnych zdarzeń 😂

17900480777736592;"¡Hola, bonic@s! ¿Cómo se presenta el nuevo mes? ⠀
⠀
Me paso hoy por aquí con “Tres citas con Carter” de betholearyauthor y publicada por sumadeletrased y que agradezco a babelioenespanol y a su #masacrítica el envío del ejemplar. ⠀
⠀
Os cuento un poco de que va, si es que aun no lo sabéis y luego os comento. ⠀
⠀
Conocemos a Siobhan, Miranda y Jane, tres mujeres con una cita y esa cita nunca aparece. Upsss, tres mujeres y un hombre… las matemáticas no salen. Y hasta aquí puedo leer porque si voy más allá corro el riesgo de soltar algún spoiler. ⠀
⠀
Lamentablemente esta historia no ha sido para mí. La expectativas estaban altas ya que he leído los tres libros anteriores de la autora y los había disfrutado muchísimo. ¿Me ha podido jugar una mala pasada? 🤷🏼‍♀️A lo mejor, pero no la he disfrutado, igual no era su momento, que puede ser, pero que una novela me dure dos semanas… se me ha hecho un poco bola. ⠀
⠀
Comencé con muchas ganas, pero no me metía en la historia. No es que no me metiera, es que no me situaba, no tenía ni idea de por donde iba a salir. Narraban las tres y eran historias independientes… Gente que se lo había leído me animaba a seguir leyendo, todo se encauzaba y que la sensación era esa, pero que al final era brutal. Pues sí, al final se encauza todo pero yo no me centraba. ⠀
⠀
La construcción del argumento me ha parecido muy lenta y necesitaba que pasara algo y cuando pasa, para mí ya es muy tarde. Los personajes me han gustado mucho, tanto Joseph Carter como Miranda, Jane y Siobhan y algunos secundarios. Si tuviera que elegir una de las historias me quedaría con la de Miranda.⠀
⠀
Sabiendo todo lo que ocurre en el libro igual más adelante vuelvo a leerlo y cambio de opinión, pero tengo muchas dudas al respecto. ⠀
⠀
En definitiva, un poco de decepción me he llevado y seguiré con la autora a ver que tal el siguiente.⠀
⠀
A vosotr@s ¿qué os ha parecido Carter?⠀

""Life is the thing you bring with you inside your own head.""✨

I found this book overhyped. The plot had so much more potential. It started well, I liked so many things about Marianne, but the book became flat with the progression. It was like reading journal entries of two characters. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, for the plot to change its course, but the same thing got repeated all over the novel. Yes, I get that it described the inability of humans to let go of habits and people, but I was expecting at least some turn to take place.

I didn't like Connell, except for the time when he punched Alan in the face. He was self-involved, insensitive, and treated Marianne like a prop and the worst part was that she endured it throughout the novel. There was no character growth even when the story covered different times of their lives, from adolescence to early adulthood. I felt so bad for Marianne throughout the book. Connell and Marianne's relationship was toxic and primarily based on miscommunication. I guess I was expecting more from this novel than what it delivered.

Q: How many tries do you give to an author before losing hope in their work?

⭐️ / 5

ʟᴀ ᴘʀɪꜱɪᴏɴᴇʀᴀ ᴅᴇ ᴏʀᴏ 🕊️ ha sido una de las mayores decepciones de este año, y lo digo con todo el dolor de mi corazón. Era una novedad muuuuy esperada, pero esta serie se acaba aquí para mí. ¿Quizás ha sido por escuchar el audiolibro en vez de leerlo? Lo dudo, pero en fin.

✨La montura favorita del rey vive encerrada, entre sedas, cojines y oro… pero entre rejas, anhelando la atención de Midas. Sí, aquel con el poder de convertir en todo lo que toca en oro, hasta a ella.

Si os soy sincera, y tras todo el revuelo, yo esperaba un desarrollo mucho más profundo, personajes de moral dudosa y una trama. A secas, una trama, o el comienzo de una. Y entiendo que este libro es una primera parte, lo entiendo, pero por mí ha pasado sin pena ni gloria.
Y como no quiero hacer una reseña del todo negativa, os dejo los puntos fuertes y débiles. Estoy segura de que este libro puede encantaros y enamoraros, solo que no ha sido para mí.

💛 planteamiento original
💛 protagonista que comete errores y no es perfecta
💛 🌶🌶🌶, aunque para mí no está especialmente bien escrito
 
💔 no tiene trama, en esta primera entrega solo da bandazos de una cosa a otra
💔 la relación con Midas me ha generado mucho rechazo
💔 igual que todo el trato a las mujeres, a las monturas… muy muy desagadable

Ojalá haber encontrado el encanto que le habéis visto a este libro, la emoción… pero no ha sido así. ¡Una pena!

Contadme, ¿lo habéis leído?

17989484659666404;"Achtung, #unpopularopinion 🫣 Zumindest habe ich das Gefühl, zu diesem Buch noch keine oder kaum negative Rezensionen gelesen zu haben. 
Fangen wir von vorne an: Vor ein paar Jahren habe ich ""Einfach Mensch sein"" von Sy Montgomery gelesen und gemocht - die Autorin schreibt darin über verschiedene Tiere, ihre Verhaltensweisen und was wir Menschen daraus lernen können. In ""Rendezvous mit einem Oktopus"" (übersetzt von Heide Sommer) widmet sie sich nur einem Tier: dem Oktopus. Montgomery ist von Anfang an fasziniert von den Kraken, von denen viele Menschen dank kultureller Einflüsse ein nicht grade positives Bild haben. Wenn man es sich überlegt, sind Oktopoden auch wahnsinnig faszinierend: Sie haben 3 Herzen und blaues Blut, können sich besser tarnen als Chamäleons, mit der Haut schmecken, sich durch die kleinsten Öffnungen quetschen und haben ein dominantes Auge, wie Menschen eine dominante Hand haben. All das ist interessant, macht aber nur einen kleinen Teil des Buchs aus. Tatsächlich ist es eher ein Erfahrungsbericht der Autorin über viele Begegnungen mit verschiedenen Oktopoden, meistens in großen Aquarien. Vor allem ist der englische Originaltitel ""The Soul of an Octopus: A Surprising Exploration into the Wonder of Consciousness"" bzw. der Untertitel der deutschen Ausgabe ""Extrem schlau und unglaublich empfindsam: Das erstaunliche Seelenleben der Kraken"" irreführend - so viel erfahren wir nämlich gar nicht über das Seelenleben der Oktopoden. Im Endeffekt hat mich auch die Art der Autorin sehr genervt und ihre Ausschweifungen über sämtliche Menschen, die sie trifft. Zudem reflektiert sie kaum die Tatsache, dass sämtliche Oktopoden in Gefangenschaft in den Aquarien leben - das hätte ich von ihr als Naturforscherin aber irgendwie erwartet 🤷🏼‍♀️
Fazit: ""Rendezvous mit einem Oktopus"" hat viele begeisterte Leser*innen, aber ich gehöre nicht dazu.

Habt ihr das Buch schon gelesen? Wie ging es euch damit? 💌

17914260932510568;"Text reads:

Please stop with the messaging that you have to be perfect to try polyamory. Some folks have a lot more compulsory monogamy (on top of purity culture) to deconstruct while taking this leap. The younger you are, the more privilege you have over those who had absolutely zero access to the internet, content, resources, or a dope support system. Some folks spent literal DECADES inside monogamy before even hearing there was another option. Most people don't even know a single healthy polyam person in real life. So, #UnpopularOpinion, some ppl might engage in problematic practices (Don't Ask Don't Tell, Couple's Privilege...) and in doing so may end up learning how dysfunctional and toxic those things can be. (Notice I said ""problematic"", not ""inherently unethical""). Some people have to make these
mistakes simply because of the generation they were raised in. And yes, they will have to experience the natural consequences of those things, and will be required to take personal responsibility. But until we live in a world free of compulsory monogamy, it's unrealistic, and frankly unfair (not to mention *extremely* privileged) to tell folks they aren't ""ready"" for polyamory. It is ok for folks to take baby steps while opening up. It is ok for folks to practice hierarchy as long as it's communicated very clearly to all partners. If my husband and I had needed to go from monogamy straight to non-hierarchical polyamory, Remodeled Love literally wouldn't exist. A posteriori knowledge (wisdom derived through experience) is the more powerful type of knowledge (vs a priori knowledge which is knowledge without experience) for a reason. Instead of telling folks they 'aren't ready for polyamory', focus instead on dismantling the fuckery that makes the transition from monogamy to polyamory so fucking difficult in the first place. ✌🏼

I really love Taylor Jenkins Reid’s writing; Daisy Jones and the Six is one of my favourite books of all time and I know how she chooses a subject and a time period, and just douses us in it from the first few words. Tennis, however, is a subject very close to my heart (ask my body clock who stayed awake twice until the middle of the night to see both Serena Williams and Roger Federer play their last matches), so I was pretty nervous about picking this up. Sports is an easy subject to mess up when you haven’t played high level sports, or don’t know the rules like the back of your hand…⁣
⁣
Let me tell you; most of the book was okay. It wasn’t bad. It also was far from being my favourite. And there was indeed a tennis mistake in there which affected my reading experience negatively (quite a few of you actually spotted it too). But most of all, it was a little flat for me.

THIS TIME TOMORROW by EMMA STRAUB
Available THIS WEEK on Tuesday, May 17!

⭐️⭐️⭐️

⏳ Goodreads Description:
What if you could take a vacation to your past?

With her celebrated humor, insight, and heart, beloved New York Times bestseller Emma Straub offers her own twist on traditional time travel tropes, and a different kind of love story.

On the eve of her 40th birthday, Alice's life isn't terrible. She likes her job, even if it isn't exactly the one she expected. She's happy with her apartment, her romantic status, her independence, and she adores her lifelong best friend. But her father is ailing, and it feels to her as if something is missing. When she wakes up the next morning she finds herself back in 1996, reliving her 16th birthday. But it isn't just her adolescent body that shocks her, or seeing her high school crush, it's her dad: the vital, charming, 40-something version of her father with whom she is reunited. Now armed with a new perspective on her own life and his, some past events take on new meaning. Is there anything that she would change if she could?

⏳ My thoughts:
If you enjoyed Oona Out of Order, you'll love this one because it's almost the same story.  I will say I enjoyed the writing itself more than Oona...it seemed to flow more easily but overall I just felt like I'd already read this book.

🔸 Devuelvo comentarios

🔺 Hoy traigo una reseña de esas que no me gusta mucho hacer y es que...

🔻No me ha gustado 

Es la segunda parte de la trilogía de Mr Mercedes y si bien el primero me entretuvo este ha sido un poco fail.

🔸De primeras no entendía la relación que tenía con la primera parte, y aunque llega, cuesta.

🔸Muchas cosas de las que pasan son fruto del azar más fortuito y no me parecían nada creíbles, así que me sacaban de la historia

🔸Los personajes tampoco me han parecido memorables así que...

✨Aunque tengo la tercera parte no creo que me anime a leerla Pronto.

❓Contadme, ¿Habéis tenido ya alguna decepción literaria?

17849179637899151;"Ein paar Gedanken zu „ body positivity“:

Ich denke, es ist unglaublich wichtig, sich selbst und seinen Körper lieben zu lernen und voll anzunehmen.
Ich finde es auch toll und wichtig, wenn man seinen Körper ‚auslebt‘.
Ohne dich zu verurteilen oder wegen etwas schlecht zu fühlen. Andere und ihre Meinung auszublenden.

ABER das darf keine Ausrede sein, sich gehen zu lassen. Ich habe viele beobachtet, die überall zeigen, wie sehr sie sich wohlfühlen, mit kaum was auf den Rippen oder sehr viel.
Es ist super, dass sie sich wohlfühlen.
Doch es gibt einige Fälle, da ist der Zustand des Körpers nicht gesund.

Und genau die meine ich. Ich hab selbst dazu gehört. Jetzt bin ich schlank, aber früher war ich dürr. Zu lernen, mich so anzunehmen hat so viel verändern.
Aber gerade weil ich mich richtig lieben gelernt habe wusste ich auch, dass ich an meinem Körper arbeiten darf, damit er gesund existieren und ich lange in ihm leben kann.

Das ist auch Teil von body positivity, den ich oft nicht sehe.

17923412831429913;"RESEÑA🧡
La noche que paramos el mundo, escrito por Alexandra Roma.
Muchas gracias a editorialplaneta por el envío del ejemplar.

🎸Sinopsis: Marina tenía la vida que creía desear. Ordenada. Segura.  Gris. Hasta que aquella noche que tenía que ser perfecta cayó el telón y todo voló por los aires. 
Noah vivía el presente. Despreocupado. Sin futuro. Con sus propias normas. Hasta que la solista deAl Borde del Abismo les dejó minutos antes de la actuación y tropezó con unos ojos verdes en un callejón.  
Deberían haber sido algo pasajero. Puntual. Un segundo en las manecillas de un reloj.
Llegaron los ensayos, el olor de la lluvia, los deseos que se sienten en la piel y la gira. Llegaron el miedo y las ganas.  
Porque que algo no sea perfecto no significa que no sea jodidamente especial.  
Porque a veces el corazón sigue sus propias reglas. 
Porque un segundo se convierte en infinito cuando logras detener el tiempo.  

🎸Opinión personal: Unpopular opinión, pero este libro ha sido mi mayor decepción en lo que va de año.
No he podido conectar ni con la historia ni con los personajes porque todo ha pasada demasiado rápido y en ningún momento me llegué a creer la historia de amor.
Las relaciones entre personajes han sido demasiado intensas y forzadas y el libro se me empezó a hacer bola.
A mi no me gusta el instalove, pero no ha sido sólo por eso por lo que no me ha gustado, sino porque en ningún momento me veía enganchada ni con ganas de leer, la trama no me interesaba y ya en las últimas páginas lo único que estaba deseando es que terminara.

Quiero dejar claro que esto es simplemente mi opinión, que a mi un libro no me haya gustado no significa que a ti tampoco lo vaya a hacer🧡

17952255749061343;"Usually, when I don't like a book, I think that I'm the wrong audience for it. This one though, I've genuinely come to loathe. 

This was an Instagram favorite, so I pondered over it for a long time even after I'd finished reading it, thinking I might have been missing something.

A woman in her fifties, M, invites a male artist, L, who she is mesmerized with, to her second house in the marsh, aptly called Second Place. She's currently married to a good man, Tony, and lives with him and her daughter from her first marriage. When L arrives with a young sexy woman in tow, M is not pleased. That's it. That's the blurb or even the entire story.

This book bothered me for two primary reasons.

1. It shows women in a really bad light. Forget the male privilege, it somehow conveys the message that women are never happy with themselves or with the men around them. It tells that women always look outside their lives for validation. Even if it is from a random stranger. 

2. For a story that tries to focus on the thin line between art and reality, it shows that artists are actually cuckoo and deserve a bad end. 

M is a frustratingly annoying character without any depth. She's superficial and self-indulgent to the max. She's neither happy nor unhappy, but is immensely dissatisfied. With what, we never know. She's angry that L is not giving her attention. She's angry that he doesn't want to paint her. Even when her husband leaves her for a brief while, she's unperturbed. L, on the other hand, is like a whiff of smoke. In its own shape, with its own form. Something you cannot and don't want to understand. The entire story is written in the form of a letter by M to someone called Jeffers.

The title clearly refers to women being in second place. Clearly highlighted with M coming after L too. But, the story does no justice to highlight male privilege or show the right impact of art.

Dear Jeffers,

I'm sorry you had to be a part of this. I don't know who you are, but you sure deserved better.

⭐ - just for the prose.

17945611766532463;"(ᴍᴜʏ) ᴜɴᴘᴏᴘᴜʟᴀʀ ᴏᴘɪɴɪᴏɴ 💔 y me duele en el alma, pero ᴛᴡɪꜱᴛᴇᴅ ɢᴀᴍᴇꜱ ✨ se lleva todas mis ganas de vivir.

En el segundo libro de la serie ᴛᴡɪꜱᴛᴇᴅ conocemos a Rhys Larsen y Bridget, guardaespaldas y princesa de Eldorra. No se soportan, pero tienen que pasar 24h juntos, compartir casa, rutina… todo, literalmente. Y, por supuesto, el roce hace el cariño…

Aunque normalmente los romances con #agegap, #forcedproximity y, más o menos, #enemiestolovers me apasionan, ᴛᴡɪꜱᴛᴇᴅ ɢᴀᴍᴇꜱ ✨ no lo ha conseguido.

El contenido de esta reseña es 100% mi opinión, no tengo la verdad absoluta, así que, si este es tu libro favorito, porfi, no me odies.

Al principio me parecía una historia entretenida, pero los constantes saltos temporales me hacían perderme, parecía que solo asistíamos a las escenas importantes en las que había tensión o confrontación… pero no a todo lo demás (la autora avisa de estos, pero el warning no ha conseguido evitar el daño). Además, la química entre los personajes no me ha convencido, ya que no la he visto desarrollarse. Siento que tengo que creerme que en la página 1 se odian, en la 100 se soportan algo más…

Aunque Bridget sí que experimenta un crecimiento más evidente, creo que Rhys comienza y termina como un personaje cero flexible y muy posesivo. No sé, creo que la situación que les toca vivir es complicada, y su actitud de “es mío y solo mío, no lo toques” es muy inmadura y poco empática. Yo no aguantaría a un chico así, aunque matara por mí.

Por otro lado, las escenas 🌶️ 🌶️ 🌶️ (que son, básicamente, el encanto de estos libros) me han dado mucho cringe. Como decía antes, no he experimentado el cambio en los sentimientos de los personajes o su mentalidad, por lo que el paso de una relación profesional al dirty talk que comparten me ha parecido extraño y nada creíble hasta el punto de parecerme incómodas. Y he leído cosas mucho peores (o mejores…), pero creo que el conjunto me ha estropeado lo divertidas que podrían ser.

De nuevo, lo siento en el alma… pero ᴛᴡɪꜱᴛᴇᴅ ɢᴀᴍᴇꜱ ✨ no se va a colar en mis mejores lecturas de este mes.

Tags: #enemiestolovers #elelegido #foundfamily #slowburn

Yo dudando si leer este libro porque decían que es racista y menos mal que lo he leído. No, no es racista, el mundo creado lo es, la autora habla del racismo de forma muy real pero lo critica, no lo aprueba y como lo hace es maravilloso ✨

Es una historia lenta, que se cuece a fuego lento pero que no se me ha hecho pesada porque el como plasma la sociedad y el poder que tiene ésta en la gente me ha tenido con el pelo de punta. Una chica de pueblo, nieta de la gran Bruja Negra que llega a la ciudad/uni donde se encuentra con un mundo cargado de distintos seres, un odio entre razas y una guerra política bastante candente.

Me ha fascinado como la autora refleja el cambio en la protagonista, como le afecta la llegada a la ciudad, como se deja llevar por pensamientos erróneos, hace cosas fuera de su moralidad pero decide dudar de todo, aprender por ella misma y elegir sus bandos. Me parece increíble el trabajo que ha hecho con la protagonista y me ha horrorizado y emocionado según momentos. El giro que da desde el inicio hasta el final con ese found family es que es 🤧

Y esa es mayormente la trama: la evolución de la protagonista y de forma más escondida pero presente el giro político que se está dando, una guerra que está a punto de resurgir, una resistencia y una profecía que me tiene los dientes muy largos. Este libro es entero de la protagonista, su evolución, sus relaciones y las relaciones de sus amigos y mira, living con los shippeos secundarios y muy curiosa con el primario. Predecibles pero no por ello menos fangirleadores. Son muy cucos todos, los adoro mil 🤍

Es un arranque de saga magnífico con un mundo real y me parece maravilloso que la autora se tome su tiempo para profundizar como se debe y hacer la historia más realista pues ese baibén de la prota ha sido lo que tenía que ser. Deseando adentrarme más en la historia y en todas esas cosas que se ven que están ahí pero apenas ha empezado a ver la luz.

18090023800293678;"Paula braucht wenig, um glücklich zu sein: Eine Wohnung, Essen und ihren kleinen Bruder Tim. Als der bei einem Unfall stirbt, bricht Paulas Welt zusammen und sie fällt in eine tiefe Depression. Eines nachts besucht sie Tims Grab und trifft dort Helmut, einen schrulligen alten Herrn, der gerade die Urne seiner verstorbenen Frau ausgräbt. Nach der Flucht vor den Friedhofswärtern begeben die beiden sich auf einen abenteuerlichen Roadtrip, der Paula nach und nach ihren Lebenswillen zurück gibt.

""Mariannengraben"" hätte mir vielleicht besser gefallen, wenn ich nicht die vielen positiven Besprechungen gelesen hätte. Wie oft es doch sogar als Jahreshighlight bezeichnet wurde! Für mich war es leider ein kleiner Flop und ganz nett zu lesen - mehr aber nicht.
Die Grundidee ist gut und es ist toll, dass die Themen Depression und Trauer durch den Roman so viele Menschen erreichen. Mir kam die Handlung aber wirklich arg konstruiert vor, vor allem die vielen Zufälle waren irgendwann nur noch an den Haaren herbeigezogen. Sprachlich fand ich es auch ziemlich schwach - vielleicht waren auch hier wieder meine Erwartungen zu hoch, aber ich habe irgendwie mehr, naja, literarische Qualität erwartet? Ich denke, dass es als Jugendbuch vielleicht gut funktionieren könnte... 
Und auch wenn sich Trauer und Depression natürlich total individuell äußern können, habe ich Paula die Depression (ich bin selbst davon betroffen und weiß, wie es sich anfühlen kann) einfach nicht abgenommen. Achja, und noch etwas: Ich hatte in meinem Leben schon so viel mit Kindern zu tun, dass ich einfach sagen muss: Kein Kind redet so, wie Tim in den Rückblenden. Auch die Metapher mit dem Mariannengraben war irgendwie nicht so richtig ausgearbeitet. 
Fazit: Ganz netter Roman für zwischendurch, der sich dank nur 250 Seiten auch schnell lesen lässt. Auch wenn das Ende sehr vorhersehbar war, war es doch spannend genug, dass ich dran geblieben bin. Überzeugen konnte mich Jasmin Schreiber aber leider nicht. Schade 🥲

18048553132319240;"#frenchfriday with the last of the classic big Citroëns: the C6. And lets bite the bullet straight away: I’m not the biggest fan of the #citroenc6.  I mean: I’d have it over any German car every day, but it doesn’t evoke desire in a way a Lancia Thesis does- even though it is prettier. 
The problem – or rather my problem- with the C6 is that I’m old enough to remember the C6 Lignage concept car #citroën presented at the Geneva motor show the spring of 1999 (4). The C6 Lignage truly represented the rebirth of the #citroen we all loved so dearly. It looked so sleek, modern and spectacular it just left me in awe. My expectations of things to come were so high…. What happened the next year however, was nothing like what the C6 Lignage had promised. The C5, successor to the Xantia and XM, looked everything but sleek and modern. It was more a case of ‘Honey I blew up the Xsara’. Citroen made us wait for an entire six and a half years before it unveiled the production version of the C6 in September 2005. The C6 looked pretty similar to the Lignage concept, but the sleekness was gone, thanks to rapidly changing (crash) safety standards. In other words: it had grown fat. The C6 was heavily based on the smaller C5, making it technically predictable – not something you’d expect from a big Citroën. Six years is a lot. In 1999 the C6 Lignage competed with the BMW E38 7-series in terms of design. In 2005 this was the E65 Bangle-7. 
#plankhondverdict: I hate to admit it, but in 2005 I felt the C6 looked dated and I never completely managed to overcome that feeling. #unpopularopinion

17979522323049635;"Unpopular Opinion:​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
I get asked all the time, ""What about accreditation?"" ​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
There is this weird fascination with bragging rights among homeschoolers. So many first-time and even newer homeschoolers are told that the only good curriculum is accredited. They are unsure if they can provide adequate education to their children, so they ask for help. That help inevitably is toted out as superior if the curriculum is accredited. Many veteran homeschoolers who prefer a curriculum that is boxed and laid out for them wave the flag of accreditation around as if it were an award they had won. ​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
It's all bogus.​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
I know that many homeschoolers want to provide their child the best education. ​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
Sometimes that comes in the form of a boxed curriculum. ​​​​​​​​
Sometimes that is lap books or hands-on kits, apprenticeships, or a multitude of other ways children learn. ​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
The short of it is that no state in the US (if you homeschool in the States) requires a family to use an accredited program. ​​​​​​​​
Zero ​​​​​​​​
None. ​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
Accreditation only comes in handy if you have a student that would potentially try out for an NCAA sport in college. Even then, many homeschooled students get on college sports teams at all levels. An umbrella school may require a particular curriculum, but because of how an umbrella school operates, they can require what they want. ​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
Accreditation of a curriculum means nothing when it comes to learning, understanding, subject matter, scholarships, college entrance, state or national testing, issuing diplomas, and more. ​​​​​​​​
It is simply a gimmick to get parents to fork over, sometimes thousands of dollars, for what they think will be a superior education. ​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
The best type of curriculum is the one that works for your child and your household. ​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
That's it. ​​​​​​​​
It's that simple.";2023-03-11 01:00:20+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:03.297396+00:00;5;10;en

Life is good without Amazon! 

Some how my Amazon account was hacked about a month ago (I’ve never given anyone access to it) and they proceeded to order 7 $100 gift cards.  I caught it and tried to reach Amazon but could not find an actual person to talk to (it’s a literal maze trying to get to any customer service). Once I did, they of course told me to contest it with my credit card company which I did.  PSA- don’t have your debit card linked to Amazon. Needless to say I was not impressed with their lack of concern or care so I decided to cancel my account.  Yep. No more Amazon for me.  Certainly I can sign up a new account and I might one day, but I don’t miss it much.  The prices aren’t that great and I’ve realized that those little things that I order that I don’t need add up quickly which more than offset any savings. 

Let’s see how long I can go without a new account.  Am I the only one?

18346507792054732;"• Una luna sin miel •
⭐️ 2/5

Hoy vengo con una #unpopularopinion en toda regla o lo que pasa cuando un libro (historia y personajes) no te llegan 🙄

No voy a decir que iba con las expectativas muy altas porque desde el principio tenía claro que era una lectura ligera, con una trama para devorar en un par de tardes y sin muchas pretensiones salvo pasar un buen rato. 

El problema es que ni Olive ni Ethan me han conquistado y su relación me parece de las más superficiales que he leido hasta ahora (ella menciona constantemente el aspecto de él y él no hace más que mirar sus pechos 🤦🏻‍♀️). 

Los diálogos no están mal pero me esperaba un poquito más de sarcasmo o ironía. Y la manera de gestionar todo lo referente al tema de la hermana de Olive por parte de Ethan es como para no volver a dirigirle la palabra lo que le quede de vida 🤷🏻‍♀️

Y luego, los dos encuentros que se producen lo convierten en una casualidad tan tan imposible (con lo grande que es el mundo) para que la historia entre ellos funciones, que me desinflé por completo con la trama.

No quiero decir que nunca vaya a dar otra oportunidad a las autoras (porque no me suelo cerrar en banda con un único libro) pero no creo que el estilo de christinalauren sea de los que me roban el ♥️

¿Os ha pasado de tener una opinión contraria a la mayoría con un libro que parece que gusta a todo el mundo? 🫤

⁣
Y’all, I’m gonna be very real with this review. Maybe too real. Maybe too harsh. But it’s been quite a while since I’ve felt this passionately about a review.
⁣
Neon Gods reads like nothing short of a 𝘍𝘪𝘧𝘵𝘺 𝘚𝘩𝘢𝘥𝘦𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘎𝘳𝘦𝘺 ripoff. It doesn’t help that it’s already an urban Greek mythology retelling. Like let’s get rid of every ounce of creativity. 🤦🏻‍♀️⁣
⁣
And y’all know I love my retellings! But when every element of the story feels like it was taken from another source, I just can’t…⁣
⁣
But really, let’s take it back to the 𝘍𝘪𝘧𝘵𝘺 𝘚𝘩𝘢𝘥𝘦𝘴 thing. We have an “innocent” woman who needs to be shown the sexy ways and be submissive and all that jazz. We have a very deeply scarred man, literally and figuratively, and we’re gonna make a very big deal over touching said scars. And we are very, very concerned about how much the woman eats. She needs to eat more. She forgot a meal? RAGE. And those are just some of the ways it’s similar.⁣
⁣
Also, the way 𝐇𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐬’𝐬 “red room” was described… bless his heart. He needs melanieruthrose to show him how to build a sex room. Maybe someone would have been willing to cross the river 𝐒𝐭𝐲𝐱 before now if he sought out her services.⁣
⁣
It probably didn’t help that I listened to the audiobook, and the narrators don’t exactly sound sexy. 🤣 I kinda felt like I couldn’t breathe every time one of them said 🐈 (which was A LOT, *we need creativity; there are lots of other words to use*) because I just couldn’t stop laughing. That was the best part about the book. How much I laughed over that one word. Maybe I should even give it an extra half star for this element of humor.⁣
⁣
Nah. 🤣⁣

Author: Delia Owens
Genre: Historical Fiction

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ 

🚨Warning! Unpopular opinion here! 🚨 
I did a combo read of audio and physical otherwise I’m not sure I could have gotten through it. 

𝙒𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙄 𝙇𝙞𝙠𝙚𝙙:

•When it was over (haha kidding 😆 if you know my sarcastic nature I had to for this one!) 
•I liked how vivid and descriptive the marsh and Kya’s living quarters were. I often felt like I was there laying on the porch bed or cruising through the estuaries. 
•Kya’s resiliency and determination.
•I adored Tate and Jumpin and even his wife they were the hero’s of this story and reminded that there is kindness in this world.
•The narrator was fabulous!

𝙒𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙄 𝘿𝙞𝙙𝙣𝙩 𝙇𝙞𝙠𝙚:

•While I thought the atmospheric writing was solid it began to be too much about the descriptions and less about the story. 
•I also learned of some inaccurate descriptions of the towns and proximity to where the book takes place. As an author I believe the research needs to be fairly accurate. 
•The character development seemed to be lacking. It’s started to pick up in the middle and I loved when Kya began to read and fall in love with reading, but I never felt connected and it kind of fell flat after that. I understand the adversity and suffering we were meant to feel with what she had to endure as a young child, but because she didn’t speak much it was hard to feel that MC connection.

I am definitely interested to see the movie though and can’t wait to compare. I love doing that with book to movie adaptations!

Uma coisa é gostar de um livro, outra coisa é gostar de um autor.

Uma coisa é “livro na estante”, outra coisa é “autor na estante”.

Li O Rouxinol e tornou-se uma leitura memorável. É um livro que vai ficar para sempre na minha estante e que quero guardar para a posteridade.

Ora, sempre que isto me acontece, tendo a pensar que “quero tudo o que essa autora escreveu”.

Normalmente, costumo estar certa. Porém, parece não ser o caso de Kristin Hannah.

Voltando atrás, aos seus primeiros livro, pesquei este em segunda mão no Tradestories. Lancei-me na leitura cheia de expetativas, ansiosa por sentir as mesmas emoções que O Rouxinol me trouxe. Infelizmente, acabei por pousá-lo depois de algumas páginas.

Tentei retomar a leitura mais duas vezes, mas não consegui sentir.

As personagens não têm um carimbo de personalidade que as distinga com naturalidade. O “motivo” é forçado e muito repetido ao longo do texto. Soa muito amador.

Vou voltar a ler a autora, porque sei que ela consegue ser incrível. Contudo, estou tentada a afirmar que os contemporâneos não são a sua praia. Vamos ver.

The songs were as deep as a middle schooler making a creepypasta fanfic, the lyrics were corny, i feel really sorry for the artists who have their art on their videos because they made a wonderful job, but the art often didnt fit with the whole song theme or atmosphere, everything from instrumental to lyrics to pvs were a mess and simply did not fit well with each other and it was their own fault since they picked them by his own choice. Also someone should tell them making vocals sound like they went through 10 shitty mics isnt cool after a bit

17930866841226454;"Time for a little round of mini reviews! 

I finally read the to all the boys trilogy by Jenny Han back in may. I had seen all the movies as they came out on Netflix but had never read the books. So yes I watched the movie before reading the book… fun fact that is what I prefer to do. I know it’s odd but it’s what I like to do. Doing it this way usually allows me to enjoy both the movie and the book… not so much in this case. 
I did like the books but I preferred the movies (especially the first one!) 
 
Ok mini review time 

📚To all the boys I’ve loved before📚
have you ever thought the movie was actually better than the book? I felt that way with this one. I loved the movie but the book was a let down. I was expecting a lot of cute moments with the whole fake dating trope but I felt like I was ripped off. I didn't have any ""feels"" for any of the moments except one, which I won’t say here because spoilers.  I wish I had enjoyed the book more than I did especially since I loved the movie so much. 
🌟🌟🌟(3/5)

📚P.S. I still love you📚
just like the first novel, I felt that this book was pretty middle of the road. I did have a few more ""feels"" for the cute moments between Peter and Lara Jean, but still not what I had hoped for. Instead of the fake dating trope, this one has a love triangle, which I had conflicting feelings about but it's a good trope.
🌟🌟🌟(3/5)

📚always and forever Lara Jean📚
I hoped that the trilogy would end better than it began, but it still wasn't amazing. I did manage to have ""feels"" for the cute moments for this one but I still wanted more. I did like how the story concluded but I can't help but wonder if they made it in the end. overall an ok ending to an ok trilogy.
🌟🌟🌟(3/5)

Overall 3 stars for the whole trilogy. 

So yea unpopular opinion, this was an ok trilogy. Didn’t live up to the hype for me and I’d rather watch the movies (especially the first one) 

QOTD: is there a movie/tv show adaption that you think was better than the book or is the books always better?
I have a few more that I think the movie/tv show was better but I feel like I’ve upset enough people with just this one😂

17859076766738334;"WARNING: Unpopular opinion coming your way…

If you look back at my most anticipated reads of 2022 I shared back in December, Book Lovers was on the list. I adored Emily Henry’s Beach Read and the synopsis of this one sounded like a HOME RUN. I wanted to love it, y’all! I WANTED TO LOVE IT.

But here’s the issue - this book was marketed completely wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

This is not a romance. Yes, there is romance but the storyline centers more around Nora and her sister than Nora and her “enemy” - which brings me to issue #2. The synopsis describes a romance between two rivals forced to spend time together in the same picturesque small town. THEY WEREN’T EVEN RIVALS. THEY DIDN’T EVEN REALLY HATE EACH OTHER. There was no angst, the chemistry was meh - the whole thing between Nora and Charlie was just blah. Enemies-to-lovers? Nope. More like, “we’re both pretty boring so let’s love each other”.

Aside from my obvious disappointment with Nora and Charlie’s romance, I couldn’t connect with Libby and couldn’t understand for the life of me why Nora was so self-sacrificing. Charlie was just okay and will likely be forgotten. Definitely not book boyfriend material.

Was there anything I liked? Yes, but in this case, the bad easily outweighed the good and as read.it.and.sleep said in her review, I think that this book would receive far fewer five star reviews if it was written by an indie author.

Leggere questo libro è come aprire tante porte, è come varcare diverse soglie e guardarci dentro. 

Curiosare le vite altrui, spostare tende e aprire armadi. Leggere diari intimi e fatti propri che dovrebbero restare chiusi dentro le mura di casa. 

Ci sembrerà strano ma non  l'ho trovato tanto irreale.  

Ogni giorno noi attraverso i social, apriamo inconsapevolmente le porte delle vite di un infinità di persone. Ci intruliamo, curiosiamo, ci facciamo gli affari degli altri e tanto facilmente ne usciamo. 

L'assenza dei nomi dei personaggi rende maggiormente l'idea di come a volte ci interessiamo di persone a noi sconosciute.

Li chiamiamo amici / follwers, ma sappiamo poco di loro. A volte nemmeno il nome. 

L'idea l'ho trovata davvero bellissima, ma l'impostazione stilistica del libro a mio avviso è troppo compassata. 

Bajani a volte si sofferma troppo su descrizioni minuziose delle case, e il risultato è un elenco di oggetti e stanze. 

Anche il fatto di usare 'io' come personaggio principale e l'assenza di nomi ha dato l'idea di una elencazione di persone come fossero pedine, non persone,  e questo non ha sicuramente favorito il coinvolgimento nella lettura sebbene ne abbia esaltato il significato. 

Una forma narrativa che potrei definire architettonica, come le case che con Bajani ho  visitato che manca di calore ed empatia.
Peccato! Per me ovviamente. 

L'ho terminato solo per curiosità,  pensavo in qualcosa di stravolgente verso la fine del libro.

17953402142224011;"Das hätte so gut werden können! Eine Familientragödie, ein altes, gut gehütetes Geheimnis, das langsam seine Fühler in die Gegenwart streckt, und die Frage aufwirft, wie gut wir unsere Eltern eigentlich kennen, kennen können. Die berührende Geschichte einer Frau eingebettet in die raue Küstenlandschaft Norwegens mit ihren Mysterien, verborgenen Gefahren, und das Ganze aus dem Mare Verlag. Ganz ehrlich? „Das Haus über dem Fjord“ von Kristin Valla, übersetzt von Gabriele Haefs, versprach alles, was für mich einen starken Roman ausmacht und begann auch höchst vielversprechend. Die „süffige“ Sprache ließ mich sofort eintauchen und schnell entwickelte die Geschichte einen regelrechten Sog. Ich mochte dieses stattliche Haus aus Elins Kindheit, das so viele Erinnerungen beherbergt, und nun, nach dem Tod der Mutter verkauft, werden soll. Mochte die geheimnisvolle Stimmung, diesen kleinen Ort, in dem jeder jeden kennt oder zu kennen glaubt, das feine Gespür für Zwischenmenschliches, die klugen Gedanken. Das fühlte sich gewaltig nach einem Highlight an und ich konnte mich all den Lobeshymnen hier nur zu gerne anschließen. Doch im zweiten Drittel ging der Spannungsbogen rapide bergab, die Themen begannen mich zu langweilen, der Fokus verschob sich. Elin ist zurück in Oslo, nimmt ihr altes Leben als Modejournalistin mehr oder weniger wieder auf und sorry, aber es interessiert mich nicht die Bohne welchen neuen Blazer sie zu welchem Anlass trägt und zu welcher Modenschau sie als nächstes fährt. Auch das Verhalten der Figuren im Umgang miteinander war für mich nicht immer schlüssig, fühlte sich manchmal an, als hätte ich wichtige Sequenzen, irgendwo den Anschluss verpasst. 

Das Ende war dann durchaus spannend zu lesen (überhaupt hat der Roman starke kriminalistische Züge), die Auflösung empfand ich jedoch als unglaubwürdig und arg konstruiert, die Themen als zu zahlreich, um wirklich in die Tiefe gehen zu können während gleichzeitig Banalitäten zu viel Raum einnehmen. Das war eine schnelle Lektüre - die erste Hälfte habe ich verschlungen, die zweite teilweise nur überflogen. Insgesamt trotz starken Beginns und guter Ideen leider nicht meins, schade!";2022-11-08 06:59:47+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:04.884663+00:00;54;400;de
17968168660788906;"I think when people think of Vocaloid pioneers we think of PinocchioP, DECO*27, UtsuP etc., but there are so much more out there who still make music to this day, and yet only have a small fallowing. I think one of the worst cases of this is Otetsu, a producer who was once praised for his use of Luka and the musician behind “Black Gold” and “Depression of Cybernetics” is practically forgotten  and only has 11.9K subscribers on YouTube, most of which are hardcore Japanese fans. Easypop was also pretty forgoten, but has luckily been given some spotlight thanks to Proseka. But it shows how so many producers who were once considered Vocaloid legends have slowly been declining despite their music still having substantial quality, and I think we should go back to see exactly how many of these producers are still around today, because being able to make music for this long with little recognition is actually astounding and requires an incredible amount of resiliency, so huge kudos to them. There are many other forgotten pioneers out there so I think using the Vocaloid DB is a great resource for finding some of these producers and where to officially listen to them.

Basically when someone tune her to sing with emotions like human and her voice could match it perfectly. Good example will be The Lost One's Weeping and Meltdown, you can feel the frustration she had in it. And that's why those songs got so popular and iconic. But surely the other vocal synths can do it too with amazing tuning skill. Rin's vocal is my personal interest and it gives me so much comfort.

17981051224597722;"Happy Friday. 🥳

I just finished The Stranger In The Mirror a few days ago. Time for a somewhat #unpopularopinion 🤦‍♀️. 

I really loved The Wife Stalker by this writing duo and was psyched to read this one. 

Here’s my review in a nutshell: ⤵️

➡️I don’t think hypnosis works this way. 😵🤷‍♀️😵

Ok, so I’m usually one that can suspend belief in a big way. A BIG WAY. For some reason here, I just couldn’t do it. The second half of this book is just so off the rails (for me). There’s amnesia stories and there’s this. I just couldn’t wrap my head around it. If you read this one I hope you loved it. I do, I really do. It was probably me - it usually is- and don’t get me wrong, I HAD to see how this one ended. It kept me guessing for sure.  I did enjoy parts of this one (mainly the first half) but overall, it just didn’t thrill me. It just kinda confused me. 🤷‍♀️ 

I think I just read too many thrillers these days. 😉

Seriously, don’t listen to me here - check this one out if you like fast moving bingeable reads with some crazy stuff going on. 
My buddy read partner and bestie niks_nook enjoyed it. Usually it’s the other way around. 🤷‍♀️

I sincerely do appreciate the publisher and authors for my paperback copy. ♥️ I will continue to read these authors as I have loved their previous books. 👍🏻👍🏻

🖤 Can you suspend your beliefs while reading? 
🖤 I usually can.

★★★☆☆
3 stars.

A note first〰️
This is one of the first books I got when I very first started reading last year, and I only got it bc of the hype / recommendations. I didn’t know yet what genres I liked and was still learning about my preferences. It’s been sitting on my shelf forever and I’m finally tackling it for my #23in23 challenge. 

My Thoughts〰️
Okay. So…IRL, I don’t like Hollywood. I don’t like movie stars or celebrities or care about all the drama. I don’t usually like romance books and I don’t like sex scenes. And really, that’s exactly what this book is.😅

However, Evelyn was fun. The plot twist was cool enough. Audio was good as well.👏🏼

Don’t take this review wrong, it was a good enough book. So many others loved it. It just wasn’t for me or my tastes and that’s okay! You might still love it like everyone else!😄🫶🏼💛✨

This would not have been a book I would choose for myself, but when I left recommendations up to my friends and followers at the beginning of the year, this was one that made the list. 
I can understand how others would hype this up, but for me it was just…meh 🤷🏽‍♀️. There were a lot of heavy topics, societal and familial pressures, deceits, and other things that irritated me beyond measure. The only relief I got from the book was towards the beginning when the main character purposely served bad food to her guests who more than deserved this gesture.
This is not my preferred genre, so that could definitely be a reason for my thoughts toward this read. Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t bad! It just wasn’t an easy read for me.

This was me thinking that a hike during one of the hottest months of the year in Hong Kong 🇭🇰 would be a good idea! Yeah nah! This day convinced me that I’m simply not a fan of it! 🙅🏻‍♀️

Unpopular opinion amongst soooo many of my friends here, and I really do wish that I enjoyed it more. But I’ve got to be honest, it’s my least favorite thing to do here and yes… it’s ok to not invite me on your hikes. Unless they’re kid friendly! 😂😂😂

The ONLY reason why I went on this one was because a dear friend was leaving HK and she always said how much she’d love to do a hike with me.  During a moment of weakness, I tricked myself into saying yes and forced myself to like it. Nope! Didn’t work! 😂

It didn’t help that…
❗️ It was like hiking in a sauna that day 🥵
❗️ My ankles and knees aren’t the best! 🩹
❗️ I forgot to cut my toenails 👣 (that’s another story 😂)
❗️ The track was MUCH longer than we thought! 🧭
❗️ I ran out of water 💦 Thank God my girlfriend had more for me! 🙏🏼
❗️ The track was an Olympic Trail! 😮 THAT should have been a warning sign for me ⚠️

But despite all of this ☝🏼. 
👍🏼 I got to spend some quality time with my girlfriend doing what she loved 🥰
👍🏼 I got to tick off a wish of hers to go on a hike with me! 🫶🏼
👍🏼 We discovered more hidden gems and gorgeous views of Hong Kong 💎
👍🏼 We found a beautiful waterfall 🌊
👍🏼 We ate yummy seafood at the local restaurants by the water 🦐
👍🏼 My step count for the day was done for the week! 😂

However.. “Never say never!”, right? Who knows. You might get me out on a hike again. But for now… let’s just park it. Plenty of other awesome things for me to love about life here in Hong Kong as I count it down to 50! ❤️

17981073658617666;"When the her ai voice was revealed a lot of people in the comments were saying things like ""she doesn't sound like herself, she's too high-pitched, etc"". But thing is, she's not even that high-pitched. If you took the time to listen, you'd realize that you have the option of making her sound like she used to, but with the CeVIO engine noise obviously. They demonstrated that you can lower the pitch a bit & that makes her sound at least super close to how she used to. Like of course she sounds a bit different, but not as much as people say. Especially now that she's been out for many months, you have thousands of song where she sounds so similar to her old self. I feel like a lot of people are just too attached to the old bank to realize how the change if engine was a good move actually. Like vocaloid is dying. If she stayed there, she would've ended up being like Piko in the long run... Also people used her at a very high-pitch as well as a vocaloid! There are SO MANY songs out there with her at a higher pitch! 1st place HAD to offer as much range or it would've been a downgrade to her previous voicebank.

17915748884534347;"UNPOPULAR OPINION 🤷‍♂️

Mit griechischer Mythologie bekommt man mich ja immer und so war ich gespannt, was A Touch of Darkness bereithält:

Persephone ist die Göttin des Frühlings, doch ihre Magie zeigt sich nicht, weshalb sie den Weg einer Sterblichen wählt. Sie zieht nach New Athens, um dort zu studieren und baut sich dort ein Leben auf. Doch eine Partynacht im Nevernight Club ändert alles, denn dort begegnet sie Hades und verliert eine Wette gegen ihn. Damit ist sie einen unerfüllbaren Vertrag mit dem Gott der Unterwelt geschlossen: Sie muss Leben im Reich der Toten erschaffen oder sie verliert ihre Freiheit für immer ...

Ich muss direkt sagen, die Geschichte hat es mir nicht leicht gemacht. Den Anfang fand ich richtig toll. Ich mochte die Welt genauso wie die verschiedenen Figuren. Besonders toll hat mir gefallen, wie die bekannten Charaktere aus den Sagen in die Geschichte eingearbeitet wurden. Vor allem Persephone und Hades waren mir bis zu einem gewissen Punkt sehr sympathisch.

Der Schreibstil ist einfach gehalten und so lässt sich die Geschichte schnell durchlesen. Es gibt auch immer wieder ein Spannungselemente und Twists die die Geschichte bereichern. Aber was mich besonders in der zweiten Hälfte immer wieder rausgeholt hat, waren die S*x Szenen. Gefühlt kam es mir so vor als ginge es jedes zweite Kapitel nur darum wie Hades Persephone besteigt und das zu jeder sich bietenden Gelegenheit und an allen Orten. Das war mir definitiv zu viel des Guten, denn dadurch hab ich das Interesse an der Geschichte verloren.

Manchmal ist weniger eben mehr, aber das ist nur meine Meinung und es gibt ja ganz viele denen die Geschichte so auch gut gefallen hat. Für mich ist das Buch daher leider nur mittelmäßig, obwohl die Geschichte um Persephone und Hades richtig gut war.

Twisted Love
by authoranahuang 
📖
Twisted Love is the first installment of the #twistedseries and the protagonists are #AvaChen and #AlexVolkov 

#Ava admires her brother's bestie while #Alex is obsessed with power to fulfill his ambition of bringing in the doom for his parents' murderers.

Both the protagonists have dark and twisted past yet their current status is much wealthier and they have all sorts of comfort but #love is one perspective of life that didn't work for both.

The book starts with the present timeline and by the stroke of luck both are stuck with the company of eachother. Thus the series of events lead both the protagonists fall for eachother.

Well the things I didn't like were-
1) Possessive male lead character
2) Profanity for his love interest

Well these are my total turnoffs and maybe that's why ALEX VOLKOV didn't make up to my #favourite #fictionalcharacter

The ones in question are not weight loss pills, they are for Type 2 diabetes, and weight loss is a side effect.

Planning on having a pretty low-key weekend to be honest. Obviously there is going to be some reading 😄 but I also want to play around with some new products for the store!

I'm #CurrentlyReading 

📕 The No-Show by Beth O'Leary (50% done) which I have so-so feelings for right now. Will probably be a 2.5 or 3 ⭐️ depending on what the 'twist' is. So far, the switching between the 3 main women's POVs doesn't give enough time for me to see enough depth to really care about them and the guy has no personality anyway. It's very surface-level but has some very sensitive topics which deserve better. I'm not surprised that I'm not loving it... O'Leary hasn't been the same since The Flatshare and The Switch days.

📗 The Invincible Miss Cust by Penny Hall (just about to start) is a historical fiction based on the true events of Aleen Isabel Cust who became Britain and Ireland's first female veterinary surgeon. I am very excited about this one and always love a #HistFic based on real badass women from history. 

What are your plans this weekend?

But I will admit that this was coming from a place of selfishness. It was always so much work to undo what happened somewhere else. 

As a Cooperative Grooming Coach, I now want every dog guardian to know they have the right to try other groomers.

Yes it could come with negative consequences that they need to be prepared for.

In the end it's your dog. You have a multitude of reasons for trying another groomer.

If one of them is that you feel or fear your dog is being mistreated either emotionally or physically then don't worry about what others might think. 

Maybe your dog just isn't doing well in that busy environment and could use a quieter salon.

Maybe your dog would really do best where they are the only dog.

Maybe your dog would thrive somewhere they are allowed extra time to adjust even if it means not competing a haircut.

18000304315629631;"💭Jaka książka podobała się wszystkim, a Wam nie?🤔

•Fotograf utraconych wspomnień• #współpraca wydawnictworelacja 

Istnieje wiele opowieści osób, które otarły się o śmierć - w niektórych z nich mówi się o wyjątkowym doświadczeniu, kiedy w ciągu zaledwie kilku sekund przed oczami umierającego przewijają się obrazu z całego jego życia. Najczęściej są to ważne wspomnienia, a czasem momenty, o których zdążyliśmy w zupełności zapomnieć.

Studio fotograficzne prowadzone przez Hirisakę - mężczyznę nieżyjącego, lecz znajdującego się pomiędzy światem życia a śmierci - jest miejscem, w którym można doświadczyć opisywanego uczucia. Ludzie trafiają tam zaraz po odejściu - to ich ostatni przystanek pozwalający na wspomnienie życia.

„Fotograf…” to zbiór trzech opowiadań, których oś tematyczna krąży wokół śmierci, przemijania i sensu życia, budząc silne skojarzenia z książką „Zanim wystygnie kawa”. Obie te pozycje mają zachwycać swoją prostotą, lecz tym razem dla mnie było jej zdecydowanie za dużo. 
W książce poznajemy kolejno bohaterów takich jak: pełną oddania nauczycielkę ratującą tonące dziecko; „gangstera”, który okazuje się być przepełnionym ciepłem człowiekiem oraz dziewczynkę będącą ofiarą przemocy domowej.
Niestety, wszystkie te, a także poboczne postacie przedstawiono niezwykle płasko i stereotypowo - mam na myśli niepełną historię Szczura (dlaczego ten chłopak taki był??) czy słabo rozwiniętą opowieść o dziewczynce. Historie te w wielu fragmentach były po prostu niedopracowane (chaotyczne przeskoki w czasie) i pozbawione logiki - już od pierwszych stron brakowało mi merytorycznego objaśnienia przedstawianego świata (bo samo powiedzenie, że taki istnieje nie wystarcza mi).
Co więcej, nie mogę oprzeć się wrażeniu, że właśnie ostatnia historia - która miała największe szanse chwycić mnie za serce - została napisana z przymusu i na szybko, byleby tylko wypełnić konkretną ilość stron.

Nie podobał mi się „Fotograf…” i wcale nie ze względu na brak emocji, które obiecywane były przez zdecydowaną większość recenzentów tej książki. Była to powieść niedokładna - mająca potencjał, ale napisana bardzo przeciętnie. Szkoda, że nie poświęcono jej więcej czasu.";2023-03-13 10:34:06+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:06.831410+00:00;26;159;pl

Artist: Natasha Allegri (Ruby design)

Additional Information: The final art by Natasha Allegri was worked upon for free though she insisted on not being paid. The concept itself was designed by Misha with some input from her friends. Misha stated that she wanted this concept to be like an 'opposite Miku'. This concept's skintone was based on Misha's mother, as she wanted RUBY to represent not only her but also her family. Temi, who collaborated with Misha in creating the concept, said the design was supposed to portray an upbeat and sporty personality. Misha wanted the outfit to reflect the Bronx, her hometown. Uniqueness and simplicity were major aims during the design process. From the beginning, sneakers were a must for the outfit, but a skirt was ruled out. The belt, shorts, and hairstyle came from the producers' desire to add a few anime aspects in order to fit more into the 'ideal' VOCALOID style. Early concepts of RUBY included a younger age and a side ponytail (Source: Vocaloid Otaku)";2023-03-02 06:42:02+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:06.831410+00:00;11;300;en
17993775136683240;"Unpopular opinion alert🚨

So I read this The Thursday Murder Club by Richard Osman and here are my thoughts🦊

In the peaceful retirement village called Cooper Chase, four friends nearing their eighty meet up every Thursday to solve old cases just for fun. But when a brutal murder happens- Elizabeth, Joyce, Ron and Ibrahim find themselves in the midst of a live case. Can they solve the murder and catch the killer before it's too late?

I had such high expectations from this one. I read the synopsis and thought it would be an enjoyable and quirky murder mystery. But it did not work for me. I rather found it dull. The pace of the book was slow. There were so many characters that it was confusing to remember all their names and who was who. I felt that the focus of the story was more on the relationship between the characters than on solving the murder. Unfortunately, I did not connect with any of them to care.

It just was not for me!

Review: 

This unfortunately wasn’t it for me !! 
I absolutely loved The night circus 5 💫 and had very high expectations for this one but it didn’t serve for me 🙊

I really tried to push it, I listened to the audiobook at the same time to try and get through it but I got so bored and wasn’t invested at all !! 

I definitely get why people love this one but maybe it just wasn’t the right time for me to read it !! 

So I decided to DNF it 30% through. I’ll definitely try and pick it up another time when I’m ready for it 🥰

QOTD : What was your last DNF ? 
What is your bookish unpopular opinion ?

***
Marta ze ""Smutku i rozkoszy"" jest czterdziestolatką, która od młodych lat czuje, że coś jest nie tak. Kobieta nie potrafi cieszyć się tym, co ma i co ją otacza, tęskni za czymś nieosiągalnym, nie umie dogadać się z większością ludzi, przeżywa za mocno. W końcu poznaje diagnozę i rozjaśnia ona nieco więcej, jednak... czy to wystarczy, aby poczuć, że życie jest, mimo wszystko, piękne? 
***

☝ To tytuł zbierający niemal same pozytywne recenzje. Podpisuję się pod tym, że tę historię wręcz się chłonie, natomiast z pewnością oczekiwałam, że wywrze na mnie inne wrażenie. 

☝Opis głosi, że to powieść słodko-gorzka, trochę zabawna, przy której płacze się ze śmiechu. Cóż, w moim odczuciu wiele tu złości, niegodzenia się z losem, smutku, rozpaczy i samotności, ale nawet między wierszami ciężko jest tu odnaleźć coś wywołującego salwy śmiechu. Ja akurat uwielbiam smutne książki, także kompletnie mi to nie przeszkadza, aczkolwiek ubolewam nad tym, że powieść Mason nie wywołała we mnie większych emocji. 

☝Czasami zdarzają się tytuły, które poznajemy z przyjemnością, ale jednocześnie wiemy, iż nie zostaną z nami na długo. Ze ""Smutkiem i rozkoszą"" właśnie tak będzie. Choć smutno mi, że nie zostanie ulubieńcem, to będę ją miło wspominać.

⁣
For someone who likes expressing in general, it's been pretty unusual the last 2 months. My gemini twin ♊ looks at me in utter surprise every morning. A few things that i observed -⁣
⁣
✨ Attraction without depth and good conversations with no intent to stay wastes a lot of time⁣

✨ Reading into people's life through their social media is a dumb thing⁣

✨ Send that message / voice note you've been wanting to send. You'll learn something out of it. Double texting is fine⁣
⁣
✨ Chances are, most of your travel plans with friends will not materialise. Grab that opportunity and try going solo. You will feel mixed, uneasy, bored but brave, you will also have your moments, some days might just suck but you might enjoy the air in your hair⁣
⁣
✨ Give back what you receive - care, food, appreciation, encouragement, company, time⁣
⁣
✨ Living on your own comes with its significant share of difficult days 
⁣
✨ You will be estranged by your close ones at the time you need them the most. Take care of yourself if and when that happens. Don't give more than you get, for once. people will stay if they want to
⁣
✨ Buy essential oils and keep a diffuser in your cozy corner. Sometimes just the act of lighting the diffuser can feel like self care
⁣
✨ Kindness and humility is sexy⁣
⁣
✨Having a routine is attractive ⁣
⁣
✨ Sleeping 8+ hours everyday is soo goddamn sexy⁣
⁣
✨ People will outgrow you and you will outgrow them too, it might not happen at the same time. So for one of you, it's going to need longer time to heal. Feel it. Let it out. ⁣
⁣
✨ Defining boundaries can feel difficult specially with people who are your own
⁣
✨ Keep it real in the world of 'fake it till you make it'. At work and in general⁣
⁣
✨ 'no expectations' is a grey zone. Keep expectations when you have to, communicate them⁣
⁣
✨ slowing down can sometimes feel uneasy. Rushing for the next thing comes natural⁣
⁣.
Go on, tell me yours below

All the Beautiful Lies by Peter Swanson

I fell behind on a few of my reading challenges over the last couple of months. One of those challenges is the Buzzword reading challenge. I decided to double up this month in hopes of catching up. All the Beautiful Lies fulfilled June’s buzzword “all”. This book had been sitting on my shelf for quite some time. So, I was happy to finally be able to knock it off my TBR. 

I was a little skeptical of this book just by reading the synopsis. I wasn’t sure that a stepmother who starts sexually enticing her adult stepson in the wake of his father’s murder would be something that I could get behind. However, I was willing to at least give it a shot because we all know that sometimes the way a plot is executed makes all the difference. 

Unfortunately, this was not executed well. If I knew then what I know now, I would have DNFed this book. I only finished it because I wanted to know what the twist would be at the end. Needless to say I was not impressed. Not only was the plot unimaginative it was also just gross. There were multiple plot points that involved inappropriate relationships between an older adult and a teenager. One of those storylines would have been questionable but the decision to include it over and over again was just disgusting. I don’t think I will be continuing on with this author. It was a one and done for me. 

QOTD: Are there any red flags that immediately turn you off from a book?

Full English breakfasts are over rated…

Prove me wrong! Do you agree or disagree?

Firstly, the importance of a big breakfast being the most important meal of the day is a myth perpetuated by breakfast food companies post world war 2. Scientifically it doesn’t hold up. 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 
Secondly…it’s SO stodgy and heavy. It makes me feel rough if I eat it all or want to go and lie down. I’ve got too much life to live to do that.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 
Thirdly, the hangover cure is also a myth. What your body needs for n a hangover is the vitamins the alcohol has destroyed. Not more stodge.

Fourthly, it has the nutritional value of a massive shit. Which, by the way, it will also make your bowel movements trickier too! 💩

I know it’s lengthy, but plz consider reading the whole thing to get an idea of why I disliked this so much.

As always, my disclaimer is that I otherwise love SJM’s books, and this doesn’t mean I hate her; just because I hated this doesn’t mean you’re wrong for loving it, yada yada yada…you get it.

I finished Nine Lives this week (my review is in my stories today—I quite liked it) and am shocked to see so many “meh” reviews on it. I was chatting with tracee traceesbookobsession about it this week (and kept saying, like what’s wrong with nine lives!? Why are people so mad at it?) and I thought what a great post opportunity for us. Think of it as the inverse to the “unpopular opinion” post except this time it’s our unpopular opinions that the book should be ranked higher. 

We came up with a few good ones and wow were we fired up. Do you get as protective of books you enjoyed as I do? Like let’s go. Out back. 😅📚🥊 some of these are near and dear to my heart and it physically pains me to see negative reviews or them not getting the accolades or attention I believe they deserve. But that is the beauty of books. What one person treasures may only be a token to others. 

All of these books have good ratings, we just thought they deserve better (cough cough Velvet Was the Night). You can see my personal reviews on goodreads (link in bio).

17905949831307963;"REMINDERS OF HIM by Colleen Hoover
⠀
3/5 stars 🌟🌟🌟
⠀
To read Colleen Hoover is, to some extent, to consciously agree to suspend reality for the duration of the novel. Which makes sense - she writes fiction. BUT. I personally struggle to endorse 300+ pages of a plot that almost exclusively revolves around an “I’ll do anything for you” relationship when its foundation was built upon one or two pages’ worth of intense instant chemistry and literally nothing else.
⠀
I believe in the instant attraction she writes about, but I personally don’t like when the relationships solidify without any sort of additional depth. I sometimes feel like I read chapter 1, start chapter 2, and wonder if I missed 15 chapters that were supposed to be wedged in between.
⠀
SO. Reminders of Him does feature that never-felt-like-this-before chemistry, but it was not the focal point of the novel. WHICH I LOVED. The romance was more of an added bonus to a plot that raised a bevy of moral and ethical dilemmas: Kenna is released from prison after serving five years for manslaughter. She’d lost custody of her daughter, whom she gave birth to at the beginning of her sentence and never even got to hold, and returns to the small town where she formerly resided - where her daughter currently resides - in the hope of being reunited in some capacity.
⠀
The issue? Kenna’s daughter lives with her paternal grandparents. Kenna was found guilty for the death of their son - the father of Kenna’s daughter - and, for a host of very valid reasons, they want nothing to do with her. Kenna connects instantly with a local bartender, Ledger, but their relationship becomes fraught with sadness and hurt and uncertainty when they discover each other’s identity. Ledger was Scotty’s best friend, and has been a surrogate father figure to Kenna’s daughter since she was born.
⠀
This book made me think about how much more inclined we are to be harsh or unforgiving or parochial when we’re hurting. Ledger’s character representes a gray area - he showed us what can happen when compassion and empathy mix with the sort of wounds that are never going away.
⠀

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️
Genre: Romance
Author: Mia Sheridan

Let me just start with saying that not every book is for every person. I thought the over all story was cute, but basically, this book just wasn’t for me. And honestly 3⭐️ was rounding up for me. I also hate writing negative reviews because I know authors spend months and years on their lives on these stories, but I do feel like I need to give my honest opinion— which I know is an unpopular one on bookstagram!

This was an insta love romance trope, so if you like that, this one is for you. I, however, do not like insta-love and it is my least favorite trope in romance. So absolutely take this review with a grain of salt based on that fact.

I had a VERY difficult time getting emotionally invested in the characters because I didn’t feel any lead up - I guess this is just insta-love though. Needless to say, I just didn’t buy into a lot of it because of that. While the character of Archer was great and I rooted for him the whole time, Bree was a different story. Hot take but she is probably my least favorite MC. I really don’t want to drone on about her and the things I didn’t like, but let’s just say I was rolling my eyes constantly.

To end on a more positive note: I really did love Archer and, again, I was rooting for him the whole time. This story overall was cute, and I could see why so many people love and rave about this, even if it wasn’t for me. I know so many incredible bookstagrammers who had nothing but amazing things to say about this book— so definitely check them out, I’ll repost some in my stories!

Also s/o to readreviewsbyjess for buddy reading this with me. I’m so thankful that we had a very similar opinion and we got each other through it!";2022-06-13 14:04:46+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:08.703196+00:00;26;0;en
17904167834454434;"Unpopular opinion: I don’t like chickens.

That’s why you are seeing a picture of geese.

I’ve tried keeping chickens. I don’t like them. 

Their poop is incredibly stinky (like the WORST). They eat an ENORMOUS amount of food and only a fraction of bugs that ducks do. Their eggs are tiny and their feet are weird.

Sorry, not sorry. 😑 Part of living the rural life is learning what works for you and what doesn’t. 

I’ll stick to waterfowl.

If anyone is in my area and wants 3 free, freeloading chickens that don’t do anything, send me that DM.

Side note, there is no snow on the ground right now. It’s been in the high 40s all week and everything is a muddy mess. [Fun fact: did you know that January in Colorado is almost always super mild? It’s a winter heat wave. Then things will get cold and snowy again sometime in February, and definitely on March.]

Anyway,  I haven’t taken any good pictures lately, and this one’s ok-ish, so here it is.

I don’t like chickens.

18345785284042466;"🛑 Unpopular Opinion Ahead 🛑

Oh man... don’t hate me 🙈

I struggled at first with the first book in the series. I realized that this is how Lucy writes her books so I gave it another go and fell in love! 

This one definitely felt like a sophomore slump for me. 

The main trope for this would probably be insta-love (one of my least favorite). I still love Score's writing style because when I was invested in this story, it had that cinematic feel where I was reading around 70-80 pages in one sitting. (Pretty hard as a mom). 

Maybe it gets better but I didn't like that Score tried to paint Nash onto Knox. Nash isn't a brooding Viking- that was Knox's job. 

Super bummed because I was so looking forward to this but I was bored, couldn't get into the story, and don't really like the instalove/lust trope.

I think Galaco is an EXTREMELY underrated vocal synth. Or course, now she doesnt hold up to any modern synths (as pretty much every vocaloid doesnt) but even with all these new synths, her voice has one of probably the MOST unique and stand apart tones, personality and sound to it, with a beautiful design. But not even that, her fall from grace was crazy. She was a universally adored vocaloid, petitions to save her (even tho she was never going to die 🤦‍♀️), alot of praise for her voice because of how unique it was, and the amount of fan content she used to get was CRAZY. But than she just… fell from grace, and now is only a vocaloid that only those of us who have really been in the community for a long time really know, which is crazy. I honestly think she had everything it took to be a big name of vocaloid, but she just quietly and slowly faded into the background. Its crazy how she went from such a dinner table name among vocaloid fans, where EVERYONE knew who she was, to pretty much unknown and obsolete. Its crazy bc like BIG producers at the time made original songs for her, like 40mp, and she just… poofed.

Admin thoughts: It's common to see synths being quite popular at release but later on everyone will forget about them. Galaco had unique vocal traits it's really sad

17958867199676331;"Unpopular take: Joy isn’t about feeling happy, joy is the ability to be in concert with EXACTLY the way life is designed, embracing its triumphs and tragedies equally.⁠
⁠
This is a dangerous statement to make given the state of the world. In the face of this much injustice and heartbreak, suggesting we “embrace” the horror with the good can seem totally offensive. ⁠
⁠
But it’s only offensive if what you’re hearing is “step aside and allow tragedy to freely happen.” ⁠
⁠
Embracing tragedy does NOT mean do nothing. It means take action, but do so in the right way. We cannot bring our anger to march at a peace rally. ⁠
We cannot make a difference when we are enraged.⁠
⁠
To quote the late gnostic intermediary Ram Dass…⁠
“The equanimity to face all of this cannot be rooted in denial. Rather it must be rooted in an acknowledgment of how it all is. But to look head-on at the horrible beauty of the universe as is, without hiding behind fantasy or denial and selective perception, takes guts…to acknowledge the violent as well as the gentle, the ugliness as well as the beauty, the greed and selfishness as well as the compassion and mercy, the sickness, death, and decay as well as health and life—and to all of it—ALL of IT—to say “YES!” – that is the ground on which true equanimity rests.”⁠
⁠
Joy means keeping our hearts open in the very moment we want to defend ourselves from our grief and terror. ⁠
⁠
From that open heart, we can take action.⁠

I’ve seen so many people try to make Vocaloid covers but either A. The singer is off beat, B. The singer is singing in the wrong key, C. The “harmony” parts are exactly the same as the melody but it’s being sung in a different key, or D. The tuning is really bad (by “tuning” I mean literal tuning, as in when the singer holds a note, it is slightly flat/low or slightly sharp/high, and it just sounds really off when the pitch isn’t quite there) It doesn’t take a musical genius to recognize these things sound wrong or weird, but for whatever reason lots of people can’t see it and just simply don’t have musical abilities.

17908821971572939;"like the people who hate the edgy English producers isnt very just anymore. I think it’s due to weeabo/Japanese elitism. Plus it’s how the producers don’t hesitate to make their stance known that they don’t like being put on a pedestal, like how we do with said Japanese producers. Plus everyone likes to conveniently ignore how all of these English producers started when they were still kids. Like ya, they’re awkward, cuz they were HEAVILY scrutinized when they were young

Is there a word to describe that feeling when you finally read the last page of a total slog of a book? Because if not, there should be.

I thought that I would enjoy this one. 

I did not. 

I ended up forcing myself to read a single chapter per day just to finish it.

Despite not liking this book one bit, I can appreciate that it was a masterpiece for that time period. I was however, bored to tears. Why are classics just SO wordy?? 

I fully admit I struggle with the classics, so this is a case of “it’s not you, it's me”. I honestly think I’m just not smart enough to appreciate books like this, and that’s ok. Am I a sucker for punishment and will read more in the future? Probably yes 🤷🏻‍♀️. 

I feel bad even giving this a rating, but if I had to rate it solely on my enjoyment? I’d give it a 1⭐️.

Extrait du résumé
Louis Creed, un jeune médecin de Chicago, vient s'installer avec sa famille à Ludlow, charmante petite bourgade du Maine. Leur voisin, le vieux Jud Grandall, les emmène visiter le pittoresque vieux ""simetierre"" forestier où des générations successives d'enfants de la localité ont enterré leurs animaux familiers. Mais, au-delà de ce ""simetierre"", tout au fond de la forêt, il en est un second, et c'est un lieu imprégné de magie qui vous enjôle et vous séduit par de mystérieuses et monstrueuses promesses. 

Ce que je garde de cette lecture c'est surtout un immense ennui. Je l'ai trouvé vraiment très long, et ce que j'aime habituellement chez King n'a ici pas du tout marché. Je m'attendais à un roman angoissant. Mais a aucun moment je n'ai été effrayé.
De plus, je ne me suis pas du tout attaché aux personnages. Ils avaient même plutôt tendance à m'agacer.. sauf peut être Jud, qui m'intéressait davantage, et que je n'ai pas trouvé cliché.

Effectivement, le drame s'installe doucement et King prend le temps d'aller de pire en pire. Mais j'ai surtout ressenti beaucoup de lenteur, de descriptions inutiles, d'évènements sans intérêt et malheureusement pour moi, rien n'a fonctionné ! La fin a été sans beaucoup de surprise. Bref, un flop.

C'est typiquement le genre de roman dont j'ai tellement entendu parler en bien, et pour lequel j'avais beaucoup d'attente. Mais ça ne l'a pas fait du tout et, pour le moment, c'est le King que j'aime le moins....

17949673418228273;"#UnpopularOpinion mental health is not solely dependent on the world checking on the strong, or sending out a search party for someone lost in a dark place… Life is lifing on all of us, the more honest we are we don’t have it all together the easier it will be for those who love us to help us

Remember most people will never know how difficult life has gotten for you, or how dark the nights are, how deep the depression is hitting, and how painful the struggles can be… I pray that you are able to find someone to talk too and love you during those dark times

Mental health much like self-esteem is the responsibility of the person struggling. No one can save you from you, but there are plenty of people willing to be there for you when you don’t know how to be there for yourself

These last few year have made it abundantly clear that there is a mental health issue… It may have always been here, and I was simply oblivious to it because it hadn’t spilled over into my circle, but over the last 10 years its become abundantly clear that a lot of people have checked out of this life in their late 20s, 30s, and 40s. I don’t blame anyone for their struggles, but it is a heavy burden to bear for the people who love you to wonder what they could’ve done, or if they could’ve called sooner… 

From personal experience to this day, I’m honored and grateful that one of my friends made that phone call, he was in a dark space but no one would’ve known if he didn’t say anything. I pray that if you read this and you are struggling, you remember that there are people in this world who love you, your pain is not a burden to them, your life is necessary, and even though we may go on without you this world is a better place with YOU.

In your darkest hour, you are not alone. Do your best to find a candle that is willing to light your candle when life’s winds of struggle blow your way

👉🏼 informed is best - it doesn’t matter how you birth as long as you made a truly informed decision that it was the best option for you or your baby.
👉🏼 every single birth should be photographed. 
👉🏼 doula’s & photographers are two different people. They are both have important roles & should be treated as such. 
👉🏼 sometimes “passion & education” comes off as “client shaming” 
👉🏼 every woman should truly know & understand her own body.

A Flicker in the Dark by Stacy Willingham

I am going to keep this one short as you have probably read a lot of reviews on this book. 

Overall, there was just too many gaps in the storyline for me. 
If you read a lot of thrillers, you may have some problems with things adding up, questioning why a character did something or just feeling like things are a bit far fetched. 

For those of you that don’t read a lot of thrillers but maybe want to give one a shot, I think you may like this one, as the story itself has good bones. Some more positives- short chapters and an overall quick read.  3⭐️

This story was inspired by a senior at work who found himself employed in fields unrelated to his major or passion early in his career. His story moved me and I wanted to share it with you as well.

Have you ever felt lost, wondering if you're on the right path? Have you ever questioned your purpose, your dreams, your choices? If so, you're not alone. Sometimes life can be confusing and unpredictable, but it's important to remember that it's also full of surprises and opportunities.

Despite his initial frustration, he embraced the journey and found value in every experience, even the ones that seemed like dead-ends. Those experiences became the foundation for his success, and he rose to become a respected and accomplished leader of the company. 

So, if you ever find yourself asking, ""Why am I doing this?"" or ""Why am I here?"" just remember that your path may not be straight, but it can still lead you to great places. It will make sense, eventually :)

17963930824538122;"📘 • The Tourist Attraction by Sarah Morgenthaler⁣
⁣
💭 • The Tourist Attraction is a debut romance novel about Zoey who takes her dream vacation to a small town in Alaska. There are some unexpected obstacles that keep her trip from being a smooth one until Graham swoops in to save the 2 week trip.⁣
⁣
I should start by saying that I do not generally appreciate a plot in which a man saves the day, like modern women are helpless beings without agency. But I try to overlook it when this happens in the romance genre. The problem with this book is the male protagonist who takes it upon himself to show Zoey, who he is smitten with immediately, a wonderful time.⁣
⁣
Graham is possibly my least favorite romantic interest ever, even without necessarily exuding toxic masculinity. He is very aggressive in his pursuit of Zoey. He gives her a pet name within 5 minutes of meeting her. If that was not enough, every sentence he utters to Zoey includes either “darlin'” or “gorgeous”. EVERY SINGLE ONE. How Zoey did not punch him in the face is beyond me and clearly shows the realistic nature of the story. Did I mention that he also growls? If you love pet names, overly masculine love interests, and men eager to get in fist fights, have I found your new book boyfriend.⁣
⁣
I was excited to read a book that takes place in Alaska. But I felt like Morgenthaler dropped the ball. Other than stating the town and a few mentions of mountains, whales, and ice caves, there was little setting to be immersed in. What is the point? The only real descriptions throughout the book is the protagonists' attractiveness and how slender Zoey’s fingers are (several times). ⁣
⁣
Overall, I really did not enjoy The Tourist Attraction. While I liked the main character and appreciated Morgenthaler having some socioeconomic diversity in the story, the dialogue and male protag were just too over-the-top. If you can look past this, you may enjoy The Tourist Attraction.⁣

I guess at the end of the day, the book was supposed to be funny, but I just had too many issues with it to laugh -- from how the author seemed to fondly reminice about her super problematic relationship with Knight, to how she manipulated her husband almost the entire book instead of just talking to him, to a scene about breastfeeding that rubbed me the wrong way (coming from a mom that's currently nursing).

I usually really enjoy this author duo, but find that I typically need to suspend reality for their books. This one just took it to another level for me, and while loneliness is a real issue and has been so prevalent during the pandemic, I'm just kind of tired of the 'lonely, naive woman' troupe. Told in too many points of view with too many timelines that I kept mixing up, paired with a plot that was a bit slow and tedious, made this a miss for me.⁣

17972815901302028;"Unpopular Opinion….

But THIS! 

I have never done a root shadow. I never will do a root shadow. I am a blonding stylist who specializes in dimensional, seamless highlights. I am thorough and get my foils close without bleed marks. Why would I turn around and cover that up? 

I am over stylists not knowing when to do a root shadow and *what* to use. 

If your clients goal is to be blonde, STOP ROOT SHADOWING WITH PERMANENT COLOR! 

A thorough consultation will help you determine not only what your client is looking for that day BUT ALSO what they want to be at their next appointment and further in the future. 

If a clients goal is to be blonde, why do a full beautiful highlight just to turn around and add a root [shadow]? 

If they want a low-maintenance rooty look, hand-painted balayage or teased foils are the routes to take. 

Going back in and adding a permanent color root shadow is not setting your client up for success for the next time they want their blonde moved up. 

If a client requests this, we need to make sure we are educating them that the next time we blonde, the lightener will have a hard time lifting your level 3 permanent root shadow to the level 10 blonde your highlights are. 

I’m seeing this done too many times for that one Instagram pic but then when that client sits in another stylists chair and wants her platinum moved up, we are left explaining why that won’t be happening and then, we’re the bad guys. WHEN REALLY… the stylist who added a level 3 permanent root shadow on their beautiful highlights (to cover their mistakes) is the one that screwed them. 

👎🏻 boo root shadows.

17993889013458388;"BOOK REVIEW: Notes on an Execution by Danya Kukafka
😕
This book left me completely exasperated; it bored me to tears. Never has a book fell so far from the hype as this one has for me. I know mine is an unpopular opinion. I’ve read rave reviews of this novel all over Bookstagram, and the concept sounded so intriguing: a serial killer faces execution, and his characterization is developed through the perspectives of three women with whom his path crossed. I found not one of these women to be the least bit interesting, and their connections to the killer veered so far off track that I could not care less about them. The extraneous and mundane details about their daily life were unbearable. Honestly, I found the serial killer to be the least annoying character, but I don't think the author intended for that to be the case. The countdown to the execution dragged on for what felt like an eternity, and even after the execution, the story managed to continue for another chapter of torturous minutiae.
😕
 As I started the book, it immediately became apparent that it was not what I expected, but I tried to give it a chance. I don’t know why I kept reading; it felt like a chore. I was so relieved to finally be done with it.  I can’t believe a novel about a serial killer facing execution could be so boring. Sorry for the rant; I just feel so utterly disappointed in this novel.  Am I the only one who despised this book? Let me know…

17897078237768765;"Rosella Postorino ha scritto un romanzo storico e di formazione ambientato nel nostro passato più recente e ha per protagonisti quattro ragazzi durante l’assedio di Sarajevo del 1991- 1992. Vedrete quindi la storia dei protagonisti partire da questo evento tragico fino al loro arrivo in Italia, assisteremo all’esperienza dell’orfanotrofio e dell’affidamento a famiglie italiane sino agli anni 2000. Il loro legame di amicizia rimarrà intatto nonostante le vicissitudini e gli allontanamenti, perché se in comune si hanno il dolore dell'abbandono, la sofferenza della guerra, il desiderio del ritorno, allora gli altri rimarranno fuori dalla tua vita, non possono che capirti dall’esterno. È stata un’esperienza di lettura che era partita con ottime premesse, ma qualcosa non è andato come speravo, ho percepito questi protagonisti come distanti, non sono entrata nella storia (voi sapete quanto io ami le storie di sofferenza e riscatto), non mi sono particolarmente appassionata a questo romanzo e la scrittura è riuscita a convincermi davvero poco. Dalla seconda metà riesce a risollevarsi ma ho davvero faticato per arrivare alla fine. Tenete conto che si tratta di una mia opinione personale e che probabilmente a qualcuno di voi è piaciuto, anzi chiedo un confronto se la storia non è arrivata solo a me ma anche a qualche altro lettore o lettrice tra di voi.

“Los nudos del pelo se deshacen peinándolos, y los de la garganta, llorando”.

📌TÍTULO: Contando atardeceres.
📌AUTORA: lavecinarubia
📌EDITORIAL: libroscupula
📌PÁGINAS: 542

📌OPINIÓN

Tras leer la primera parte “La cuenta atrás para el verano”, de la que me gustaron unas partes más que otras, quería darle otra oportunidad a su segunda parte, pero he tenido las mismas sensaciones o peores😕.

🔹Lo que más me ha gustado:

🌅 La estructura y organización de la novela con capítulos cortos.
🌅 Enseñanzas que nos deja: aprovechar las segundas oportunidades que nos da la vida y disfrutar de la vida con sus luces y sombras, entre otras.
🌅 La madurez con la que afronta sus dificultades y su toma de decisiones.
🌅 El pasado siempre vuelve y ese aspecto de la trama me ha hecho sacar una sonrisa porque tengo simpatía por ese personaje.
🌅 AMISTAD. Valor que lleva por bandera de principio a fin.
🌅 Me ha removido por dentro, especialmente un tema, y me quedo con las reflexiones que he sacado.
🌅 Aunque casi todos los capítulos los narra ella, hay algunos por otra persona y eso enriquece la historia.
🌅El capítulo final me ha hecho reír, aunque haya sido lo único.

🔹 Lo que menos me ha gustado:

🌅 Las primeras 200 páginas me han parecido flojas, planas y el final predecible. Solo se salva el giro de la trama hacia la mitad, que es lo que me ha tenido enganchada y tocada.
🌅 Repetitivo en varios aspectos: sus frases, bromas, metáforas, temas… ha sido como si estuviera en su cuenta de Instagram, al igual que pasó con el primero. Me esperaba algo diferente.
🌅 Ha habido veces que no he reconocido a la autora en su manera de hablar y expresarse. Y algunas frases las he visto forzadas.
🌅 No me ha gustado las decisiones y comportamientos del protagonista masculino.

Sé que es una “unpopular” opinion, pero yo no he podido verlo tan maravilloso. De hecho, el final se queda abierto para una posible tercera parte, y yo ya no seguiré. Pero a vosotr@s os animo a leerlo, ya que os puede llegar de otra manera.

2,75🌟

Thoughts:

So I think this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but I didn’t love The Cloisters. I was super excited to read the book, but it just didn’t do it for me 🤷🏻‍♀️

In fact, I found it a tad boring, and it wasn’t at all what I expected. I thought it was going to be a book about secret societies and some magic, but there isn’t any of that. 

There are some plot points throughout the novel that I felt like just got dropped, and I finished the book with a lot of questions. 

The book is short and definitely gets in those dark academia vibes, and also, the cover of this book is stunning and I’m obsessed. 

Ann has just finished undergrad when she gets an internship at The Met Cloisters. When she arrives, things aren’t as they seem and she’s taken with the other intern, Rachel. 

What’s a book that let you down?";2022-09-24 13:24:11+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:11.144185+00:00;18;0;en

17885561696799486;"𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙒𝙚 𝘿𝙞𝙨𝙖𝙥𝙥𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙚𝙙 is a compelling historical novel of the unsung victims of war; the women and girls captured and enslaved to provide sex for their occupants. It's a deeply emphatic story with much presence and sentiment despite the horrific circumstances and vivid descriptions. Wang Di's voice is breathtakingly human and convincing and had the story been hers it would have been a magnificent read. Unfortunately for the flow and atmosphere of the story, the shifting perspective of 12-year-old Kevin is rather unsuccessfully blended in creating more disruption than meaning. Undoubtedly, to show the complex impact of generational trauma but - for me - contrivedly so distracting from an otherwise impactful reading experience.

I wished I had loved the novel as much as I have seen many others do, but as fluent as one story was, as hesitant did I feel the other was. Do we disagree?

⁠
Maybe an #UnpopularOpinion but I did not like DS2. 🫠 It truly had all the makings of a movie I'd love with Sam Raimi coming back—I LOVE that horror style and wish they leaned in even more into it. 😂 Zombie Dr. Stranger was honestly amazing, but I hate how it left Wanda.⁠
⁠
I don't hold characters too precious when it comes to their moral compass wavering and can completely understand why Wanda would go full villain (in fact, I love that they did it), but there was a huge lack of buildup for me with her character jumping straight from Wandavision.⁠

Interested in what comic readers or Wanda fans think!⁠

The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern

Sooo this could be controversial guys but I didn't love it. I probably liked it just enough because I appreciated the creativity and imagination into it. But I did feel like it was one of those too hyped up ones for me and I was expecting a bit much maybe? I don't know. All I know is I didn't get the buzz. Some of it, I just didn't get. 

Have you read it? Do you agree or do you want to rant at me? Would love to discuss with someone!

18174312328248197;"Shall I start by saying this is an #unpopularopinion ? 

It has taken me a very very long time to write something about this book. Mostly because I was not ready. Sam Masur and Sadie Green have a love and hate relationship. They become friends at a very young age and go through many ups and downs in their friendship. But what binds them together is the passion for creating games. So, you know, the main plot is GAMES. 

At first, I felt it is going to be a sweet journey with Sadie and Sam. I was not particularly happy with the characters, but I felt the need to find a reason why they behaved the way they did. And honestly, I understood it at some point. I felt sad for Sam. I could feel his frustration and irritation because of his physical impairment and the stubborn idea of never seeking help. I felt empathetic towards Sadie, coz gurl! all of us make mistakes and that's okay. But to revere in those mistakes is what Sadie Green is. 

What I wanted from the book was to know more about the characters. To know Sadies and Sam and Max (oh, dear Max!). But what I got instead was details and details of how they made video games. I am not saying I hated the book but did I love it? I don't think so. And on top of that, this is the book that won the Goodreads Choice Awards over The Winners (by Backman), I cannot digest that!

Read it with my fellow btp.bookclub and I am sure badphoto_goodbook will have a lot to talk about his hatred towards Sam and his love for Max! 🤭";2023-01-22 04:47:37+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:11.144185+00:00;5;36;en

18349415947008556;"There is a lot going around these days with “techniques” & “overloading” in regards to exercise. #unpopularopinion 

We see sooo many professional sports people perform in many different areas such as sprinting, tennis, swimming, rugby, powerlifting, running and many more, where they manoeuvre there bodies into all sorts of positions & with different loads. This is because they have trained, conditioned and “built up” the strength to do so within these disciplines. 

A non- runner doesn’t wake up one day and says “I’m going to run my first ever marathon tomorrow” with no such training, discipline and guidance WITHOUT the concept that they MAY “injure themselves”. This is just common sense right. We need to condition our bodies for the extreme activities we are doing. This also includes 
- bending over to pick up a heavy box 
- reaching behind us in the car to grab something from the back seat 
- jumping down off an object onto the floor from a substantial height
- hiking up a mountain with no directions or idea of the weather 

These are all activities that may seem easy but it’s quite simple… if you fail to prepare, you prepare to fail. 

Now failing isn’t a bad thing at all, but when it comes to failing your body… this is what we call (lack of awareness of your bodies capabilities).

Some movements are called “bad” but for some people, there bodies are so accustomised to the level of force / that specific exposure, that the are less likely to have a “negative effect”. 

Examples of movements that people think are “bad”:
- ankle inversion (rolling your ankle) 
- flat feet (pronation)
- plyometric jumps
- spinal flexion
- running on cement barefoot
- running with high shock absorbing shoes on
- running (hurts my knees/ hip)

There are many more but you probably see where I am going with this. 
There is never a “bad” movement, it’s just at the time you performed said exercise… your body wasn’t ready for it. If you really want to give it another go… PREPARE your body for it. Don’t know how? Ask a professional for guidance.

This morning as I was vacuuming the house, my son was sitting on the couch watching TV with the cat. As I got closer, the cat panicked and tried to run away. But instead of letting the cat go, my son continued to hold on as tight as he could. Eventually the cat was able to wiggle his way out of the embrace, but ended up scratching my son in the process. 

One of my favorite mantra's in our home is that ""it's not helpful if it's not helping."" You see, in this moment, my son he felt like he was trying to keep the cat safe, but the problem was that the cat had his own ideas about what actually felt safe! Instead of respecting the cat's freedom to choose what works for his body, my son tried to force what he felt was best for the cat, but in reality, it was what was best for my son. He wasn't ready to let go of the cat, and in that moment he choose his own comfort over the cats under the guise of helping. 

Non-attachment is the practice of letting go of our attachment to things, beings, and outcomes. It reminds us that while we can't control everything in life, to include our feelings, we can control our reactions and attitudes towards them. By adopting a non-attachment mindset, we free ourselves from the burden of trying to control others and allow ourselves to focus on our own behaviors, thoughts, and feelings. This can lead to healthier, more fulfilling and authentic relationships as we learn to appreciate, love, and accept others for who they are as they are, without trying to change them to fit our own desires, preferences, or expectations.

Soooo… My sister urged me to read Carley Fortune’s Every Summer After, which I know has been a massive hit here on the ‘gram and elsewhere.

Well, unpopular opinion ahead but… it did nothing for me. Normally my sis and I are on the same wavelength when it comes to reading, so this came as a surprise to me. Then again, very few books have been hitting the spot for me recently, so maybe it’s me?

This was a coming-of-age romance, a back and forth between teenage summers spent by the lake and the messy reality of being a 20-something, making do. I loved the Canadian setting. But that’s about it.

There wasn’t anything wrong with this book, it just simply didn’t do it for me. I couldn’t gel with any of the characters, the plot didn’t convince me and the twist was pretty predictable. I was left feeling meh…

Sorry peeps if this was one of your faves. But I’m here to post my honest reviews. If you loved it, please tell me why. Maybe I missed something?

Ich hab die Reihe hier so oft auf Booksta gesehen und sie wurde/wird so extrem gehyped das ich sie mir auch zugelegt habe. Aber naja was soll ich sagen, der Zug ist wohl an mir vorbei gefahren 😅 Normalerweise bin ich die erste die von einem Buch schwärmt wenn ich höre es geht um Enemies-to-Lovers oder es gibt ein Knife-to-Throat Trope. ⚔️❤️‍🔥 aber hier konnte es mich leider nicht überzeugen. 😕
Ich glaube mein größtes Problem war die Protagonistin Jude, sie war mir einfach zu störrisch und machthungrig. Ich wurde mit ihr leider gar nicht warm.. Cardan hingegen habe ich von Buch zu Buch mehr gemocht. Aber irgendwie hat mir trotzdem was gefehlt.. 🤷🏽‍♀️
Es war einfach eine Hass/Liebe zwischen mir und den Büchern. Trotzdem fand ich konnte man die Bücher gut lesen und sowohl das Setting als auch die Handlung waren wirklich super. Nur die Umsetzung konnte mich nicht so richtig überzeugen. 🤷🏽‍♀️

I buddy read this w/ kts_library_reads + I think it was the world’s slowest buddy read 😂 we moved at the same snail pace + shared many similar thoughts! 👯‍♀️

I liked it, but wasn’t my favorite of hers. Don’t get me wrong, it’s good, but didn’t come close to living up to the high bar set by Beach Read!

What I loved:
- Great banter 
- Bookish themes 
- Small town + indie bookstore😍
- Good dose of wit + humor 
- Sassy + funny female MC 

What I didn’t love:
- Enemies to lovers imposter! It actually felt like acquaintances to lovers- I needed more initial hostility!!
- Sister relationship was a bit much (borderline codependent 🥲) + wanted more of the romance! 
- Enough of the “sissy” 😫😬😂 if it was in a sarcastic/funny way sure, but nah these sisters legit called each other sissy + I wanted to 🤮 

Overall, this was 3.5⭐️ read for me. I needed more from the plot + romance! Unfortunately, I didn’t find myself dying to pick it up + the big reveals were not exciting to me 😩

18211255804125990;"Book Review ✨ 

Hostage by Clare Mackintosh 

I saw this book a lot last year and I can see why there is so much hype around it. 
The plot is unique, it is faster paced than some thrillers (the whole book takes place within a couple of days) & it pulls you in. 

With all that being said, I don’t think it was the book for me. 
The multiple POVs was very confusing for me to follow, and I typically enjoy multiple POVs in books. I thought there was a lot of far fetched moments, especially at the end and it just felt a bit choppy. 
I thought the main characters were well written, but I hated their relationship and had a hard time with some of their “issues”- again, maybe a bit far fetched in my opinion.

The plot felt kind of similar to the book Falling by T. J. Newman. If you read and enjoyed Falling, I would recommend reading this one. They are different enough, but I think if you enjoy one, you would enjoy the other. 
*Like most thrillers, make sure to check TW before beginning.

2.75 ⭐️

Book of Night by Holly Black
Pub Date: May 3rd, 2022

Ok, I’m here with an unpopular opinion. 🙈 I was SO excited for Book of the Night, and even before it was announced as a #BOTM pick, there was so much hype! 🖤 I eagerly received my preorder, cracked it open…and could not get into it. I tried for about 120 pages before deciding to DNF this one for now. 🫤

This was Holly Black’s first adult fantasy novel and, to be honest, it shows. 🤷🏻‍♀️ It seems like the author is trying very hard to be gritty and action-oriented, but it just felt forced. And the magic system is intriguing but so confusing—I still barely understood it when I was a third into the book. ✨ And, I’m curious: Did anyone else feel like the protagonist was *almost the same character* as the female MC in VE Schwab’s Shades of Magic series? 🤔 Unfortunately, a DNF for me.

People just don't even use other synths name becase Vocaloid was the most famous one and probably for habit or nostalgia, every vocasynths become just Vocaloid. Just to think about Miku, she isn't a Vocaloid anymore with her NT voicebank, but still we call her Vocaloid

While logos are an important part of branding, they are not enough to make your target audience remember your brand.

Do you think the consistent use of fonts across all channels is more important than logos?

I’ve never had one but I assume they’re an uncomfortable, costly fiasco.

❌ Someone touching your feet

“In Alaska you can make one mistake. One. The second one will kill you.” ― Kristin Hannah, 𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑮𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒕 𝑨𝒍𝒐𝒏𝒆

Alaska, 1974.

Unpredictable. Unforgiving. Untamed.
For a family in crisis, the ultimate test of survival.

Ernt Allbright, a former POW, comes home from the Vietnam war a changed and volatile man. It seems nothing or no one can fix the thoughts and feelings inside his head. That is until he decides to move his family north, to Alaska, where they will live off the grid in America’s last true frontier.

Thirteen-year-old Leni, a girl coming of age in a tumultuous time, caught in the riptide of her parents’ passionate and stormy relationship. She is desperate for a place to belong. Her mother, Cora, will do anything and go anywhere for the man she loves, even if it means following him into the unknown.

~ My Thoughts ~ 

I know this isn't likely to be a popular opinion but honestly, it's mine and mine alone. Hannah's writing is incredibly beautiful. She paints quite a vivid & lovely picture of Alaska. So, there isn't any argument there and I actually quite liked the first 70% of the book. 

I was rooting for Leni, I enjoyed her friendship with Matthew and I was waiting for Ernt's dangerous end-of-the-world prepping to come to a head. This book really brings Alaska and off-grid living to life. But then it all fell apart for me. 

I felt like Hannah was just adding things in to make the book longer. The last third of this novel seems to contain a lot of filler and thus loses much of the magic. 

Characters dying, a teen pregnancy, murder and running away. It was just fluff. And the ending to me felt rushed.

You tell me that women have to have children and a family consists of mother, father, child. 
You think that cannabis should remain forbidden. You don't vote because nothing changes anyway. You think that you don't have to distinguish between wage work and care work and that content creator is not a real job. Yes, that, exactly that would be my view. We wouldn't fit together and I wouldn't be sad about it. 🖤🖤🖤

Owszem, spisane językiem wprost pięknym, obfitującym w mnogość metafor, kunszt słowa oraz bogactwo chwytliwych fraz, miały szansę wybitnie zachwycić. Zresztą, wcale na tym polu talentu autorce nie odmawiam; Ciarkowska fenomenalnie operuje swoją prozą i tworzy przed czytelnikiem jej sugestywny obraz, niestety jednak, zdania okraszone poezją (bo niekiedy takie właśnie odnosiło się wrażenie) nie są w stanie rekompensować rzeczywistej treści. ⁣
W tym przypadku treści nieco miałkiej i nijakiej. ⁣
⁣
Bo dla mnie, ,,Dewocje’’ wcale nie będą ‘strumieniem samoświadomości, w którym główna bohaterka odważnie rozprawia się z aspektami wiary widzianej z różnych perspektyw’, wręcz przeciwnie – powieść, przynajmniej w moich oczach, jest symbolem uprzedzeń, utartych schematów, krzywdzących założeń, kopalnią fragmentarycznych refleksji. Nie odnalazłam w tym tytule niczego dla siebie; trudno było mi jakkolwiek sympatyzować z historią wiejskiej dziewczyny rzuconej ‘na pożarcie’ zamkniętej zbiorowości; ciężko było mi się zaangażować, skupiać i współodczuwać, ponieważ niewiele z nakreślonego przez Annę Ciarkowską portretu do mnie prawdziwie przemówiło. ⁣
⁣
Ani element przerysowania, ani pierwiastek tajemnicy, ani specyficzna narracja, nie stanowiły żadnego atutu. I choć doceniam sam zamysł, a nawet ogromnie mu przyklaskuję, nie mogę zignorować formy w jaką został opakowany. Piękna wydmuszka naszpikowana oczywistościami – tak. Coś więcej – nie.⁣

18340405204059494;"BOOK REVIEW
The Housemaid by Freida McFadden

⭐️⭐️.5/5

A seemingly perfect couple hires a maid to help with the chores around the house, including cooking and watching over their little daughter at times. The couple has a dark secret but they're not the only one, the new housemaid has her own share of secrets too. 

Where to even start with this book? I was looking forward to it but ended up disappointed.

Unpopular opinion here but this book was a bit of a letdown for me. I’ve read so many 5-star reviews about it that I couldn’t wait to sink my teeth into it, only to find out that it has Behind Closed Doors written all over it.

Behind Closed Doors by B.A. Paris was published in 2017 and The Housemaid was published in 2022. 

Coincidentally, Behind Closed Doors ended with the abusive husband being locked in a torture room of his own design that can only be opened from the outside and dying of dehydration. The similarities don’t end there; I can say there are just too many.  It felt like I was reading the same book all over again.

While this was entertaining and I wanted nothing more than to flip to the last page to get to the ending finally, I can’t say I was blown away. Perhaps I will have better luck with Freida McFadden’s other books.

This Woven Kingdom by Tahereh Mafi
(2.5⭐, YA fantasy, swipe for synopsis)

I think you'll enjoy this if you like/aren't bothered by:
* fantasy romance
* star-crossed lovers/insta-love
* Persian-inspired setting
* more telling than showing
* purple prose

Alizeh is an interesting character, but she was criminally underutilized. She lacks any agency in her own story: the devil's whispers force her to move from town to town, Kamran's magnetic presence binds her to him, and on and on it goes. Every step she takes is made possible by a male character, and not through any action of her own. 

Then we have Kamran, who very quickly got on my bad side by being sexist and classist and also just an ass. For example, he has known his minister, Hazan, since childhood, but never thinks to ask him how he is. There are multiple sections where he threatens Hazan with bodily harm (like horsewhipping), which Hazan seems to take in stride.

As usual, the insta-love romance didn't work for me. Even though there were a handful of moments between Kamran and Alizeh that I enjoyed, just remembering how little they actually know each other tossed any glee I felt right out the window.

The book also really tries to up the drama whenever it can by having abrupt chapter ends and then shifting away to a different POV. Everyone in this book overreacts to everything; Hazan is the only character to come across halfway reasonable.

There are also some serious pacing issues. The author spends pages on Alizeh looking around a marketplace, lost in her own thoughts, or Kamran brooding beneath the trees. I think the book could easily have been 100-200 pages shorter without losing anything important to the story. The purple prose doesn't help, and sentences that were probably meant to be impactful just come across as confused.

I was really hoping for something more than fantasy romance. There's so much potential for intricate political machinations, or deep discussions on racism and classism, but we didn't get any of that. In fact, barely anything happens. Definitely feels like a missed opportunity for something that could've been quite unique.";2022-04-30 14:45:16+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:15.221007+00:00;32;300;en

No es ningún secreto que en esta historia se habla de infidelidad, tal y como indica la sinopsis. No me escandalizo, no soy moralista, ni defensora acérrima del ""matrimonio"" hasta las últimas consecuencias. 
Pero no me ha gustado el enfoque: sexo, mucho sexo con poca elegancia y demasiado explícito, (pero para gustos los 🎨), me da la sensación de que justifica y en cierto modo ""ensalza"" la infidelidad, como salida ante la monotonía, o de una crisis de pareja ...pero creo que no todo está permitido. 

No he podido conectar con Gabriela, pero puedo comprender sus sentimientos, sus carencias y he llegado a identificarme por momentos con ella.
Tampoco me gusta la ""nobleza de los maridos"", tal y como la autora la denomina,a veces me ha parecido, que se les llega a ridiculizar innecesariamente,pero entiendo que la historia versa sobre los pensamientos más íntimos de las protagonista, y quién no ha puesto a caldo a su pareja alguna vez! 😅

Sí tengo que destacar el final, creo que hay un mensaje entrelíneas sobre la relación de un escritor con sus ""alter egos "", que me ha dejado un tanto loca...

Para mí, es una historia que no me representa pero que comprendo, y sobre todo una sorpresa bestial, en cuanto a la idea que tenía del tipo de novela de la autora, pero SÍ (aunque suene paradójico), la recomiendo, es una lectura que tenéis que leer olvidando la novela anterior y desde vuestro propio criterio y principios.

Estoy deseando que me digáis qué opináis si la habéis leído!💬

17938985288504055;"✨REVIEW✨

Author: Ali Hazelwood
Genre: rom-com
Rating: 🌟🌟💫

I don't think ya'll understand how much I wanted to love this. The Love Hypothesis was one of my FAVORITE books from 2021 and I was blown away that it was a debut novel. Also, I want to preface this review by saying everyone will have varying opinions, these were all things that did or didn't work for *me*. I've seen other reviews and talked with other friends who read this one and loved it!

I'm going to start with some positives. I really liked the subplot shining a light on the GRE and the whatwouldmariecuriedo Twitter feed. The conversations that stemmed from those struggling in the science field were important and brought some light humor to the topic. There were also some cute/funny moments that I enjoyed. 

Unfortunately the rest of the book was a big miss for me. The story felt like a carbon copy of TLH, but with a few name and location changes. I couldn't tell you any defining characteristics about our male lead besides the fact he is SUPER tall, a scientist, and lacks communication skills. Speaking of communication ... if you hate the miscommunication trope, this may be a hard read for you. Also, there was a lot more science jargon than in TLH and I found myself bored/confused during those parts. This could be a positive for some readers, but didn't work for me, especially in a romance. And finally, the conflict at the end was absolutely ridiculous. It's hard for me to get into without spoiling, but I was cringing through it.

If you were not a fan of the Love Hypothesis, you certainly will not be a fan of this one. If you were, maybe still give it a try? It's a quick read and you may love it!

Since reading LOTB this weekend I cannot stop singing Rihanna! (i'm sure my husband is ready for me to stop singing it lol) What song has been stuck in your head lately?

Thank you Berkeley and NetGalley for my eARC in exchange for an honest review! 🫶🏼";2022-08-28 23:55:23+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:15.221007+00:00;109;0;en

17946670721145917;"#PSA: STOP RACING 5K RACES IN HIGH STACK SHOES!

#UnpopularOpinion but you are doing yourself a disservice if you want to maximize your performance. Those beefy midsoles are great for saving tired legs at the end of a half marathon, but the extra weight and stack height isn't helping you run any faster at shorter distances. Ever tried cornering and navigating the tangents of a fast course with 40mm of foam underfoot? I wouldn't recommend it. Enter the #SkechersPerformance #SpeedElite Hyper!

The racing shoe designed for kingcheserek has a stack height of 23mm in the heel and 19mm in the forefoot.  While the ground contact feel is there, the Hyperburst midsole and carbon infused have winglet plate do an excellent job together for both shock absorption and propulsion. I have been racing and doing track workouts in the Speed Elite since its long anticipated released in late 2019, including a sub 14:30 road 5k. This shoe comes in at 5.9oz (!!!) in my men's size 10.5. Goodyear rubber is placed only in areas where it's needed. The upper is minimal, yet locks the foot down like a glove. If you haven't tried Hyperburst yet and/or are in the market for a short distance road racing flat, give the Speed Elite a look. It's on sale basically everywhere. This thing is just wicked FAST! Use for track work, tempos, and races from 1 mile to half marathon.

17996039788736278;"UNPOPULAR OPINION … most people think grocery shopping is a chore to be slogged through. Me? I love it!!! I seriously get giddy making my menu plan and thinking about which stores I’ll need to hit to get all my shopping done. Yes, I said stores, multiple grocery stores 😆. One disclaimer, it has to be grocery shopping ALONE.

I like to start with the best bargain store - Aldi for me - to see what deals I can get on grass-fed meats and organic produce and then I work my way up - ending at Sprouts to fill in the gaps. I mean, I am that person with my phone calculator figuring out which pastured eggs 🍳 on sale give the best price per egg. 

I also love reading labels, and there’s something peaceful about taking my time and strolling 🛒 the store aisles to read labels at my leisure.

Who’s with me? Or are you instacart all the way??

18175675135252233;"🔆BOOK REVIEW🔆 Spare Prince Harry Duke of Sussex 
NO RATING (memoir)

Read this book if you like:
🤴The Royal Family
✨Memoirs
👨‍⚖️Suits

What I loved:
I preface this with I don’t feel it’s right to give a star rating on memoirs as it’s one’s account of their own life, so how can you possibly rate that, ya know? I truly feel for Harry and Meghan and believe that if they didn’t leave, Meghan might have met the same fate as Princess Diana (controversial, I know) so it was great to hear Harry’s perspective on his whole life, and just how daunting the whole monarchy is (and weird.. at the same time) I do wish them all the happiness and hope that the press moves onto something else 

What I didn’t love:
Honestly, if you watched their Netflix special - this is basically the same other than it dives VERY deep into Harry’s experience in the military and his life in his 20’s. If you’re a Royal Family buff then you might love all these little details, but I feel like we are getting regurgitated information at this point and only ONE side to the story. Unfortunately unless we get a fly on the wall to tell us all the dirty details of the royal family, it’s always going to be Harry and Meghan vs the rest of the family. 

NOTE: these are strictly my own opinions and I did keep many of them out as I know we all have our own thoughts on the royals, the controversies etc. which I’m not gonna get into because it’s SO polarizing. Regardless of all that, the way the media treats all of these people is maddening, and I am so grateful everyday I’m just a regular Joe who shares book reviews on IG🤣";2023-01-31 16:48:28+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:15.240420+00:00;7;55;en
17983390552695945;"#opinion El simbolismo se ha vuelto pan de cada día de los últimos gobiernos, en especial el del presidente Duque y sorpresivamente el actual gobierno sigue ese mismo camino. 

Sin embargo, ¿hasta que punto los hechos simbólicos son realmente relevantes? o simplemente son un desperdicio de dinero para que la gente "" coma "" del asombro. También es cierto que los medios tradicionales han masificado este simbolismo, un claro ejemplo fue lo sucedido con la llegada de las vacunas en Colombia, donde posiblemente cada hora hacían el seguimiento a las mismas como si eso hiciera que llegasen mas rápido o mágicamente llegaran más, en cierto modo la única explicación es que son ""esperanza"" para las personas. 

En el actuar del actual presidente desde el día de su posesión ha estado repleto de simbolismo, comenzando con la traída de la espada de Simón Bolivar, no sumaba ni restaba a la posesión, lo único que hizo fue mostrar nuevamente un simbolismo de ""esperanza"", que si ha sido materializado en los mas de cien días de gobierno, eso ya queda a reflexión de cada uno de ustedes.

Y un ejemplo más reciente esta todo el tema de la frontera con Venezuela, la reactivación del comercio y en especial el tema del trasporte aéreo, donde al igual que las vacunas, se les hizo un cubrimiento especial acerca de la salida y llegada del mismo, y todo estaba rodeada de esa ""esperanza"" , no obstante, a día de hoy los tiquetes entre rutas colombianas y venezolanas son altamente costosas ... y es ahí el punto de todo esto, si el simbolismo lleva consigo acciones reales, el simbolismo es justificado, de lo contrario y suena un poco cruel, pero simplemente es gastar dinero en darle cubrimientos como un juego político o aún más triste, vender esperanza a la población y al final no materializar en nada.

I love her and I see where the writers were going with the character (and I love pagets portrayal of her ofc) but I just felt like everything about her was kind of one dimensional, even more so after she came back. I think this applies to most, if not all, of the female characters tbh. For example, I find JJ to be quite bland and without personality. Penelope literally only has personality when she’s in the scene with Morgan or Alvez. Tara is hilarious but her character barely got any development. Blake and Kate were okay but again, minimal development. And poor Seaver never even got a chance”

17987753614767800;"“Kakepâtis. It means fool.”

⭐️⭐️

Quote chosen specifically because that’s what these characters were. Fools.

We start with Mackenzie, a young woman living on her own in Vancouver, where she’s having terrible nightmares of her dead sister, inexplicably able to bring things back from her dreams, and being followed by crows. After nearly dying because of one of these dreams, she finally decides to go back home to the family she’s been avoiding for some years to get answers.

It sounds exciting, so I was saddened when I eventually realized I was bored. It’s a lot of the same thing in the beginning, Mack dreaming or talking about her dreams. There’s an element to it that felt pretty obvious from the start, but won’t be acknowledged until 64% into the story and that got exhausting to have to watch characters be confused about something that shouldn’t have been confusing.

But I persisted because it’s a short book, less than 300 pages, and I was hopeful that the end could pick up. And it’s an Indigenous centered story, a Cree family written by a Cree author, of course I want to love it and give it all the chance that I can!

*sigh*

I don’t know how old Mack is exactly, but it’s too old to be acting the way she does. I’ll break it down to adults (the mum and the aunties) vs the kids (Mack, her other sister, a cousin). The adults are doing most of the research, but not sharing any of their findings (which will just end up being stuff we already knew or isn’t helpful.) The kids will decide since the adults are keeping secrets, they will too. I could scream. Even when we talk and agree no more secrets- Psych! Of course Mack isn’t listening. And when it’s time to go face the Big Bad, the kids just feel it’s ~right to go on their own - and the adults pack ‘em a bag and wish them luck. I’m choking.

Admittedly, I skimmed the final showdown, which was anticlimactic and surprisingly easy for something that had been irrationally overpowered for the rest of the story. Plot armor ftw. Overall, I was disappointed.

17873553629821162;"Finlay Donovan Jumps the Gun by Elle Cosimano

🌟🌟🌟✨(3.5)

Pub date: January 31, 2023
Format read: split e-arc and arc-audiobook (audio for these is well done but does make it harder to keep up with all the side characters who are often relevant)

❤️ If you saw my post from last week, you will know that I adored the first book in this series. It was my favorite book of 2022. Finlay Donovan is one of my favorite characters I’ve come across in a book! The second one was still pretty good but I didn’t enjoy it as much as book 1. 

😬 Unpopular book opinion: Sadly, this was my least favorite so far in the series. I feel like the series is loosing its steam and this book didn’t feel as interesting as I expected it to be. I feel like it didn’t further the storyline overall. Nothing has compared to book 1 with the humor, mystery, and page-turning adventures. Part of me wishes this series has just been a standalone. 

😕I have always struggled with series. After book 1, they just don’t live up to the hype. There are a few rare series that I do really love. 

❓What have been your favorite book series? Do you struggle with loving the later books in a series too?

Het bestverkochte boek van 2022, favoriet van menig bookstagrammer en getipt door daphne.readsnl voor de #12booksby12friendschallenge; dat beloofde veel goeds.

Helaas was dit boek niet mijn cup of tea. De schrijfstijl, vele gedetailleerde natuurbeschrijvingen en het tempo (laag) waren niet voor mij. Richting het einde (het laatste kwart) werd het wel iets beter, maar het veranderde mijn mening over het boek niet 🙈

Wat vond jij van dit boek?

Kya Clark is in haar eentje opgegroeid in een moeras, afgesloten van de bewoonde wereld. Om zichzelf te onderhouden ruilt ze vis, en groenten uit haar moestuin voor andere levensmiddelen. Ze voelt zich er thuis, beschouwt de natuur als haar leerschool. Maar als ze in aanraking komt met twee jongemannen uit de stad ontdekt ze dat er ook een andere wereld is. Wanneer een van hen dood wordt gevonden, valt de verdenking onmiddellijk op Kya.

I genuinely loved both albums “MANNEQUIN” and “Undead Alice” and one thing I love about DECO in general is how he differentiates in style every couple or so years. But why is it that the people who didn’t like MANNEQUIN are like “I miss old DECO” and “ He should go back to making rock songs” when it’s been like 10 years since his first style and like 7 since “GHOST”. It’s understandable to stop listening to his music but it annoys me so much when the same people go back to his new songs and comment crap like “it’s mid” and “when will he make GUMI songs again?”. When Undead Alice released I’ve haven’t heard anything about it when it had some genuinely great rock songs like Naninani, Secret Feast, I’m So Sick of You, and Fake Actor. That album felt a lot more like his older rock songs/ Conti-New phase than the songs in the Android Girl album (it’s more electronic/pop than rock). Hachi fans on his Vocaloid career wouldn’t go to Kenshi Yonezu to say his newer work sucks, so why DECO fans?

It Ends With Us is a story about how the ones you love can hurt you the most. After finishing it and discussing it, we have some unpopular opinions to bring to the table! Sorry bookstagram!
🌷
Lily hasn't always had it easy, but that's never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She's come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up — she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily's life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.
🌷
We had quite a few issues with this story. Starting with characters and finishing with a complete lack of diversity. However, we must admit that the book's second half was a little better than the first, but let's start at the beginning! The book begins as a love story and almost immediately introduces us to Ryle - soon to be a neurosurgeon and about to fall in love with Lily. This is where problems start. 
🌷
According to the book, Ryle is supposed to be extremely attractive, romantic and charming. However, he borderlines as a rapist and stalker, literally following Lily around and begging for sex on his knees. Apparently, this is somehow supposed to be romantic. Oh, and of course, he is working 48 hours straight but still looks like a greek god. On the other hand, Lily is only 23 but has already managed to reach the highest point of her career, burn out, quit and fulfil her life dreams. And finally, everyone in the story is white, everyone is super rich and super successful. Diversity? Never heard of it!
🌷
The story's second half finally reveals what the actual story is about. And the book starts to improve a little. We are shown the real side of Ryle, learn about Lily's past and finally get introduced to some emotion rather than a scenario from soap opera. It was a lot more interesting to read, and we are happy with Lily's choices in the end.
🌷
Shallow, predictable, cringy and in our opinion not worth the hype. Not sure we will be picking up more of Colleen's books.

Naprawdę czekałam na tę książkę z wielkim zainteresowaniem i miałam co do niej duże nadzieje - jak inaczej można zareagować na wiadomość o powieści, w której sekrety starożytnego Egiptu łączą się z historią Atlantydy, a śmiertelniczka wykorzystuje swoje legendarne zdolności odszukiwania artefaktów, by pomóc nieśmiertelnym bogom i aniołom odzyskać dawno utracone berło światła? Przecież w tej historii wszystko aż krzyczy, że oto przed nami niesamowita przygoda!

A jednak, mimo że sama historia była nawet przyjemna, cała reszta zrobiła na mnie okropne wrażenie - zaczynając od wtórnych pomysłów, przez kreację bohaterów i ich absurdalne zachowanie, na korekcie i tłumaczeniu kończąc.

Dlatego czuję silną potrzebę, żeby tę moją niezbyt pochlebną opinię odpowiednio umotywować. Co też czynię na kolejnych zdjęciach, gdyż za nic nie zmieściłabym się w treści posta 😅

⚠️ #unpopularopinion 

📖Legends and Lattes by Travis Baldtree

❓What’s the last book you didn’t like that everyone else did? 

Oy! 

Ok, yes this is a cute story that has some decent little hidden messages. Like don’t judge a book by its cover, acceptance, you get back what you put in and yadda yadda. But here’s my issue. Since I couldn’t just sit and read it in one sitting because well life had other plans. I had to force myself to read it. There was nothing holding me there or calling me back to it. I never thought about it during my day. if it wasn’t for a 4hr car ride I’m not sure I would have ever finished it.  There was a little gem for me towards the end that made me go “ooh, there it is, finally!”, the turning point where I wasn’t pissed I read it. 

So yes it’s a cute story. Characters we’re likable but for me the story was missing the hook, the thing that keeps pulling you back. The need to want to know how the story ends. Little background I have owned this book since it was self published before the publisher TOR picked it up. The hype didn’t do it any favors. Wish I read it when I got it. Oh well on to the next. I do hope this author writes more. I’d like to see the progress. The characters were original and I liked them. 

In short: 
Did I like it? Ehhh it was ok. 
Would I recommend it? Idk about that. 
Would I read more by this author ? Maybe, I’d like to see if the next book has a hook.

17951905586448499;"📖 Avis lecture 📖 
« L'inconnue de la Seine »
de Guillaume Musso
chez Le Livre de Poche

« Il ne pleuvait plus. Roxane se dépêcha de sortir de la voiture. L'humidité imprégnait ses vêtements, ses cheveux, son cerveau. »

💫 Suite à un événement qui ne nous est pas rapporté, Roxane, policière, est envoyée se mettre au vert dans un service qu'elle ne connaissait pas jusque-là, le BANC (Bureau des affaires non conventionnelles).
À son arrivée, elle va se passionner pour une enquête en cours : une inconnue a été repêchée dans la Seine, nue et en état de choc, et s'est enfuie avant qu'on ne puisse l'identifier. 💫

❌ J'ai sur ce texte un avis très mitigé.
L'intrigue m'a plu, ainsi que les références à l'art et à la mythologie, et j'ai trouvé qu'il était original d'introduire des éléments visuels comme des articles de journaux ou des captures d'écran.
J'ai par contre été dérangée par quelques saillies bien senties et peu nuancées sur les méchants manifestants (tous les mêmes...) hostiles à l'égard des forces de l'ordre. Le langage était quant à lui assez familier (et je ne parle pas des dialogues mais bien du corps de texte dans lequel on rencontre « bagnole » ou encore « foireuse ») et la façon de parler des narrateurs n'était pas non plus suffisamment différenciée à mon goût. ❌

-Unpopular opinion
Molte persone tendono a giudicare male i romanzi autopubblicati, definendoli libri di serie B. Ma io non la penso così e oggi voglio darvi un consiglio: non demonizzateli, perché anche tra loro si possono trovare delle storie di qualità, e ""Axel Meyn - I misteri della città di Lavaesh"" ne è un ottimo esempio. Un esordio col botto quello di Simone Sarnataro, che ci catapulta in una storia avvincente e ricca di suspense dalla quale è difficile riuscire a staccarsi, scritta con uno stile molto particolare che arriva dritto al cuore, facendo talvolta ricorso a termini ricercati che rendono ancora più immersiva l'esperienza di lettura, perché ci danno l'impressione di essere davvero in un'epoca medievaleggiante. Fin dalle prime pagine risulta evidente la profonda ammirazione che l'autore nutre per il maestro J. R.R.Tolkien, che si concretizza nella cura con cui è stato creato l'ottimo world building, tra creature fantastiche, città dai mille volti e terrificanti sotterranei dove accadono i più grandi orrori che si possano immaginare. Inoltre sono certa che come me molti lettori potrebbero identificarsi in Axel e desiderare di abbracciarlo forte, mentre si trova alle prese con maledetti doppiogiochisti, subdole canaglie che hanno la faccia tosta di definirsi umane e soprattutto con nuovi incredibili amici destinati a diventare la sua compagnia.

17972619694976723;"“Strange noises, bad vibes, your mom and dad recently passed— Your house is haunted and I’m not selling it until you deal with that.”

⭐️⭐️

So this was Hendrix’s second attempt to convince me that he ~gets mothers and the sacrifices they make for their children — and fool me twice, shame on me. I’m still left with the notion that Hendrix doesn’t like his mom all that much, especially when we hit the passage where it states there’s no difference between mothering and manipulating. Like wow, who hurt you? Mom, apparently.

So the concept of the book has us saddled with Louise, a single mother who will never let us forget that she’s a single mother because every aspect of her identity apparently hinges on that. Her parents have just unexpectedly died in a car accident, which brings her back home to deal with all the estate stuff and unfortunately to butt heads with her polar opposite younger brother, an overweight man that we will never be allowed to forget is overweight because I think maybe Hendrix might have some fatphobia in his arsenal as well — but that was just my sense, don’t quote me on it! 

But this house is creepy af and filled to the brim with creepier puppets, and the spooky stuff starts happening immediately. And soon it becomes pretty apparent that maybe there was more to their parents’ death than meets the eye…

Overall this book was actually fine, there were plenty of solid chunks that I managed to enjoy. The characters were largely unlikeable and inconsistent, the humor was okay, and the horror… started off really strong, but swiftly jumped the shark and frankly is responsible for dumping this from a three star to two. What we get in that stupid attic… 🙄

If you are a stickler for what kind of haunting you’re after, do know that this isn’t really a haunted house, it’s haunted dolls. I’m down for either or, so I’m disappointed that it didn’t work, but also not surprised because I knew in advance that Hendrix and I don’t vibe. But now I really know for sure!

I’m being a little generous in this review because I love Tartt’s writing. However, I think I was a bit let down after reading the Goldfinch (which might be my #1 book thus far), readers I respect putting it in such high regard, but… and I hate to say this…. all the meanings felt a bit too obvious to me. With the Goldfinch, there was consistent meaning, and it was done in a way that moved me, which I did not feel much through this story. I liked it a lot, enough that I will keep it on my shelf, but I’m not sure if I would read it again. 🤍 I would personally recommend reading Tarrts work in order. I found myself going backwards.

🔥: open door romance 
🛑 Spoilers ahead 

We all know this was a highly anticipated sequel to 𝗜𝘁 𝗘𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗪𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗨𝘀. I read IEWU back in February for the first time. It was the first and only CoHo book I’ve read. I did enjoy the message of IEWU, but honestly it was the author’s note at the end which drove up my rating. I had a problem with the ending of the book knowing that Lily was allowing her daughter anywhere near Ryle. It seemed reckless, and I couldn’t understand why she would allow it. I felt closure with Lily and Atlas at the end of IEWU and thought it was a perfect ending for them. 

So I will say that I got my answers with why Lily was allowing Ryle access to Emerson. It made me sad that Lily had never reported Ryle because this is what happens when domestic abuse isn’t reported. 💔

So here are the problems I had with this book. An entire book was just simply not needed. It reads like a really long epilogue, and a novella would’ve been perfect in my opinion. I needed those answers with the custody situation, but what I didn’t need was a whole extra storyline with a new character. Fans wanted this book for more of Lily and Atlas, but their relationship took a backseat in this book in my opinion. And we get an entire chapter of them “𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁"". Seriously how many times can grown adults talk about making out? 🤦🏼‍♀️ The Tik Tok reference also made me roll my eyes and did not belong in this book. 

Perhaps the biggest miss for me was, once again, not talking about mental health. There are so many characters in this book who have been through so much. Why aren’t we mentioning their mental health or counseling? Ryle could’ve been helped so early on had he received counseling as a child because of what he went through. To me it was just a big miss by the author. 🥺 

After discussing with my book club last night there seems to not really be any consequences for Ryle at all in both of these books. Is he even truly sorry for what he has done and continues to do? Lily is very fortunate that she has a strong support system. A lot of women in domestic abuse situations do not have that support system.";2022-11-18 17:05:50+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:18.603248+00:00;37;375;en

But what made this different was as the final chorus happens then everything pops out and then there’s all these colourful objects everywhere, similar to the stage in DIVA series. The choreography is good as it is, but it definitely feels a bit more expressive with how Rin will occasionally show a more sad expression, but other than that it really is just a great PV and I’m sad it isn’t in Future Tone (as I am with other the other Mirai PVs that weren’t ported).

4/5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

A Court of Wings and Ruin is the one ACOTAR book to keep my attention and shift the series from “meh” to “ok, yes”.  I knew from the ending of ACOMAF that I needed to know what was going to happen next with this group.  I say, group because the supporting characters will always be my favorite part of this series.....besides Rhys 🥵🔥. I enjoyed getting to know a little more about the characters.  

World-building and plot development is something SJM does well, but I would prefer the books to be shorter.  I feel like so much is thrown at this group at times and I ask myself if it is all necessary.  For someone who easily gets absorbed into books when reading, this series doesn't do it.  So many times I found my mind wandering with the previous books.  This time I found myself ready to get back to the story, bumping this as my most liked book in the series. After reading this, I would consider going back to give the entire series another try.....if they weren't so darn long. 

Even though it feels like everyone has read this series, and loved it....I know it's not true.

✨ QOTD:⁠ What are you reading this week?⁠
⁠
📖 Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus⁠
⁠
📌 Elizabeth Zott is a chemist who faces sexism and sexual assault in the workplace. One day she meets her intellectual other - rowing, a dog, love and pregnancy ensue. Years later, Elizabeth finds herself hosting a cooking show based on chemical processes and turning the world around for women.⁠
⁠
💭 Lessons in Chemistry is a story about loss and resilience. I liked the concept of the story but the execution didn't work for me. The eccentric Elizabeth is an intriguing character and I appreciate what the character does for women. ⁠
⁠
I didn't find it to be a very charming novel and was actually just appalled throughout. The misogyny and discrimination faced by women in the 1960s honestly doesn't feel too different from today but it felt a little mishandled in the novel. ⁠
⁠
The juxtaposition between serious topics of sexual harassment, suicide and rape with the POVs of both a dog and five year old was baffling.⁠ The POV changes were constant and very abrupt. The dry humour didn't grab me like it did with many other readers, so it just fell flat the majority of the time. The trigger/content warnings should be a lot more prominent. ⁠
⁠
Lessons in Chemistry just didn't end up being for me but many other readers absolutely love this story.⁠
⁠
⚠️ CW: rape, sexual harassment, suicide, depression, sexism, loss of a loved one

So, in these slides I try to clear up some confusion. I used the word “unpopular” advisedly: This is sure to make some people frustrated. But the theme woven into each of these points is simple and clear: Ukraine is nation of fiercely free and brave people who especially since their Revolution of Dignity have been taking back their country from a powerful corrupt elite.  
 By the way, not included in these points but worth mentioning: Contrary to what realdonaldtrump , russellbrand , and my friend jackmposobiec say, Victoria Nuland, a bureaucrat in the U.S. State Department did not create or design Ukraine’s Revolution of Dignity. 😂

No bureaucrat could plan such a society-wide transformation, when Ukrainians reclaimed their language, culture, heritage that soviet and imperial Moscow had so long tried to destroy.   I don’t understand why people who praise the much smaller Ottawa truckers movement choose to denigrate Ukraine’s Maidan Revolution. 

Of course, Nuland and so many others were trying to manage the fallout, you know, to make sure Ukraine didn't choose someone too radical, like, say, an actor as their leader (as they did 5 years later) but if you examine history and you love freedom, you might come to love the Maidan mentality.   From my story at Poland’s tvp_world — link in bio.

Now, I know this might ruffle some feathers within the reselling community….especially considering that the Good Will bins are where many resellers get their inventory, because it is so affordable.

But hear me out….there are other ways to source (just as cheaply) and better charities to donate to!

Here’s why to stop supporting:
Good Will is legally a non profit, but certainly not morally a non profit, and it has been proven through their actions and business behaviors. 
🚩Less than 1/8 of profit goes to charities
🚩Some workers make less than minimum wage
🚩They dump unwanted goods to 3rd world countries 
🚩🚩🚩People with disabilities have died due to Good Will’s negligence 

Instead of supporting the reselling giant with a hidden dark side, research local thrift stores and charities in your area and start shopping with and donating to them. You could also source through your local Facebook marketplace and stop by yard sales or flea markets. 

👏There are many other options out there, we DO NOT need to continue to support Good Will’s poor business practices!👏

È sicuramente superfluo dilungarsi sulla trama e i vari riferimenti a questo libro visto che è uno dei più famosi e letti nell'ultimo periodo. 
Passo, quindi, subito a dirvi perché la mia è un' #unpopularopinion e perché questo libro non mi sia piaciuto. 
Non è un caso che abbia deciso di pubblicare questo post nel giorno di #sanvalentino, anche se è una scelta un po' ironica perché è proprio il racconto di questa storia d'amore a non avermi convinta: l'ho trovato un pochino stucchevole, esasperato e a tratti molto lento. Per 3/4 del libro la lettura mi è risultata noiosa e soprattutto fossilizzata su elementi troppo romanzati; non che mi aspettassi un saggio storico, ma avrei preferito una via di mezzo che rendesse giustizia ai personaggi e alle loro caratteristiche. Invece mi è sembrato tutto troppo astratto ed esasperato e ciò ha portato, secondo il mio punto di vista, a togliere carattere e veridicità ai personaggi che non sono proprio due sconosciuti qualunque. 
Anche il contesto storico mi è sembrato troppo trascurato e fantasioso, quindi i sentimenti troppo moderni, facendo virare il romanzo verso il romance (categoria che a me proprio non piace). 
L'unica parte che ho apprezzato è stata quella finale, sicuramente di grande effetto e commovente.

Vi è piaciuto questo libro? 
Cosa ne pensate del rispetto del contesto storico?

18176225986255186;"i saved my favourite unpopular opinion for last⁠
⁠
There are so many opinions about what makes a writer and good writing. SO. MANY.⁠
⁠
I think in some cases, the unpopular opinions are becoming more accepted and understood by this writing generation (or should I say these writing generations?). People are understanding the craft as more than write every day, good grammar or bust, and only certain types of writing count.⁠
⁠
Can things like education help you understand storytelling better or see things in a new way, for sure. But you don't strictly need it. ⁠
⁠
Does knowing grammar rules help you know how to break them? You betcha. But strict grammar perfection makes for very stiff storytelling.⁠
⁠
Is it fun to rebel against tropes and put a spin on them? Totally! But tropes are tropes for a reason. They're beloved. It only takes five seconds of looking at bookstagram to see how much people are drawn to certain ones. (Morally grey, who did this to you, and touch them and you die are my faves!)⁠
⁠
Writing is a craft. Storytelling is an art form.⁠
⁠
(Also, I'm sorry, but sometimes the screenwriter does a far better job with the story and characters than the novel writer.)⁠

J'ai péniblement lu De Lune et de Sang de Erin Beaty, paru chez lumeneditions Merci netgalleyfrance de m'avoir permis de découvrir ce roman. Je n'ai pas adhéré à l'histoire mais la lecture fût tout de même une expérience intéressante.
📚
Catrin escalade les murs du Saint Sanctum de Collis. Elle inspecte et veille à la bonne tenue des échafaudages pour le compte de l'architecte en chef, le Magister Thomas. Un soir, éclairée par la Lune, elle est témoin d'un meurtre d'une violence inouïe.
📚
Catrin mènera l'enquête, quoiqu'il en coûte. Elle se lie avec l'enquêteur désigné par le prévôt. Simon de Mésanos semble en savoir beaucoup sur la psychologie du tueur...
📚
Pourquoi ça ne l'a pas fait avec moi ? J'ai trouvé trop de longueurs. J'ai été déçue de tourner sans arrêt en rond autour de ce Sanctum. Catrin vit et évolue dans un périmètre ultra réduit. J'ai eu l'impression de parcourir le même bâtiment encore et encore.
📚
L'enquête ne m'a pas intriguée outre mesure non plus. Les descriptions sont assez sensationnelles mais n'ont eu aucun effet sur moi. J'avais envie de lever le mystère sur Catrin, sur Simon et surtout sur Juliane. On met tellement de temps à les aborder que je me suis lassée.
📚
J'avais lu de bons avis sur ce roman alors j'avais peut être trop d'attente...je vous conseille le compte de pulpobonito pour un avis positif sur cette lecture ! ❤️

It’s okay to say “no” to fit ins.

Yep, I said it.  Stop 🛑 overbooking yourself AND your team.

Instead, make your schedule based on the needs of your clients.
🐾 Getting a lot of same day urgent calls - block off appointments that can only be scheduled same day.
🐾 Getting that influx of preventative care appointments? Maybe make a couple weeks light on illness appointments or vice versa

Your schedule does not have to be the same format all year round- adjust to the needs of your team and your clients! 

Some other helpful tips I use when making my schedule
🩺 Make a template for your CSR so they know exactly what type of appointment they should be scheduling and where
🩺 Only book a month or two in advance to avoid vet shopping and no shows

Does this mean we are cold hearted and never see overbooks? No, but its most definitely not an everyday thing! 

What are some things you do to avoid overbooking your schedule?

I’ve done No Spend Day Challenges in the past and I’ve come to a realization that this challenge may not be the best for me. I would get too fixated on not spending money and often feel guilty for buying the milk I needed or whatever else I needed that day. I think it definitely helped me buy fewer things that I “wanted” but I didn’t like beating myself up for having to color in for that day for spending money even if I just spent $4 that day. I started to focus more on meeting my budget for that week or month instead of counting all the No Spend days. If my budget for the week was $150 and I spent money every day of that week but stayed within my budget, I will celebrate that. You have to know yourself and find what works for you. It’s kind of like dieting. You may eat healthy all week but binge eats on your cheat day. That doesn’t work for me. It’s all about balance and self-control. It’s not easy but worth practicing daily. 

Again, this is not to say tracking No Spend days are bad. It could be a great method for someone else but I wanted to share my thoughts about why it wasn’t for me. And all to say that it’s okay to not like something that is trending or popular. Not everything is for everyone and you don’t have to like something or make yourself like something just because other people are doing it.

18209676049130480;"VIETE V ČOM STE UNPOPULAR? 

Hashtag #unpopularopinion sa tu v poslednej dobe extrémne rozmohol a úprimne, dosť mi lezie na nervy. Vo väčšine prípadov mám pocit, že ľudia nejdú proti prúdu z vlastného presvedčenia, ale len preto, aby boli iní.🤷‍♀️ #unpopularopinion že jo 😀

Ale teda, toto, a aj unpopularbrand ma donútili zamyslieť, v čom som nepopulárna ja a zhodnotila som, že som tak celkovo “too much”.😅

• príliš veľa rozprávam (shoutout všetkým, ktorí pozerajú moje storky so zvukom😂)
• k tomuto by som ešte pridala, že rozprávam príliš nahlas - aj delusion_for_brunch pozná slovo “nekrič” 😀
• som príliš sebavedomá - ja osobne si to nemyslím, ale verím, že toto veľa ľudí nevie prekusnúť
• ukazujem toho príliš - a úplne rozumiem, že ľudia, ktorí nemajú dobrý vzťah so svojím telom sa môžu cítiť nepríjemne
• som príliš emotívna a všetky emócie mám vyhrotené - keď sa smejem, smejem sa nahlas, keď som smutná, plačem, keď som nahnevaná, kričím
• som príliš naivná, strašne verím v dobro ľudí a nachytáte ma na hocičo
• som príliš farebná, nekonvenčná, liberálna, odhalená a určite keby si prejdem svoj inbox nájdem ešte množstvo pomenovaní.🙏🏻

Ale som to ja. A som na seba hrdá.❤️ Viem kto som, own my shit a verím, že stále robím dobré veci, aj keď niekedy možno wrong way.🙏🏻

Vynechala som niečo? V čom si myslíte, že som unpopular? A v čom ste vy?🤔

17977455175610465;"Malibu Rising - Taylor Jenkins Reid 

⭐️⭐️⭐️💫

TJR .. TJR .. I just can't decide if I like you or not. On one hand I absolutely adored Evelyn Hugo as it has definitely been my top book of 2022 read so far. While on the other hand, I despised Daisy Jones. Now here we are with a book I just found mediocre... I'm all over the place with this author!

I absolutely loved part one of Malibu Rising. The creation of the characters and their stories were both fascinating and heartbreaking. I definitely had all the feels and was 100% emotionally invested. I loved the jumping between past and present and the layout of how the story was being told. 

THEN once part two hit I was struggling to push through, I didn't even really want to finish the book. Part two was just WAY too much excessive drama, drugs, alcohol and partying - just not my vibe for a book , hence why I wasn’t a fan of Daisy Jones … hmph. 

The one thing that I absolutely loved about this story is hearing about the brief appearances of other TJR characters from 'Evelyn Hugo', 'Daisy Jones', and her new upcoming novel - 'Carrie Soto Is Back'.

I'm still super salty about this book being the winner of best historical fiction of 2021 on goodreads... I do not consider the 80's 'historical' and there weren't any major events that even happened that linked to any historical events whatsoever. I think this was definitely more of a family drama / contemporary fiction novel. I felt the same way when Daisy Jones also won best historical fiction of 2019 ... like no. Just no.

Thanks to the lovely wutheringvines for sending me this book as a Christmas present forever ago 🤣❤️

17929038755617513;"🍂BOOK REVIEW🍂

Rating: ⭐️⭐️

I’ve seen this book is quite popular and has great reviews. As I can understand why people like it, I have a to say that it didn’t do it for me.

We follow Lauren in this post-apocalyptic world and the way she struggles with all that, and I always find that really interesting. However this time is the exception, I found the whole thing quite boring, I dislike the main character most of the time, I just didn’t understand her or any of her decisions.

I didn’t understand the whole Earthseed religion and why in the world would anyone follow a religion that she just made up and doesn’t even make sense.

Also her relationship with the guy introduced later on, was a big NO for me, it made me feel uncomfortable. His character as the others weren’t developed enough, at least not enough for me to care about them.

I was really disappointed by this one, but I won’t discourage anyone that wants to read it, because I’ve seen great reviews, and a lot of people loved it, just wasn’t for me.

Have you read this book? What did you think about it?

I found myself getting distracted easily, checking how many pages were left in each chapter and literally saying out loud ‘of course he can’ • Alex could honestly problem solve anything, he had all the resources, all the money and all the connections, but fleeting details on how or why?

Also would Ava, with her past and her trauma, be ‘sunshine’?

Verity by Colleen Hoover (3★)

Don’t yell at me.. but Verity fell a bit short. 

Holy overhyped! Don’t get me wrong, this was in no way a bad book. I enjoyed the mystery and the thrill and the SPOOKY sh*t show that was this story. However.. I was expecting to have my mind blown and alas.. it was not 😅 

Bookstagram really had me thinking I was going to be stuck on this book long after I read it and in reality, I got to the last chapter and was like “well that was weird..” It was okay - entertaining, but not fantastic! 

It was interesting, and wrong in so many right ways but I definitely think it was overhyped.  I will say tho.. the opening line of Verity is one of the  best opening lines ever 😶

This has me thinking: is this how I’m going to feel about the other CoHo books I have lined up? Ugly Love and It Ends With Us have been burning holes in my shelves! But it seems like all of her books are hyped so that makes me verrrrrry apprehensive 🤔 Am I alone in this?!

Q: Is there a book that Booksta/Booktok made you read, but it turned out to be just meh ? 🤷🏻‍♀️

the lyrics were originally generated with a bot, though edited by GHOST. i feel reckless battery burns is how AI SHOULD be used in artistic media. the song, while the lyrics have no actual meaning, is genuinely a bop and the chaotic mv makes it so much better. (i also just love tamari (character in the vid) ahaha.) someone in the mv’s youtube upload commented this, but ai shouldn’t be used to “replace” art or anything, rather inspiring it. even if it can make something incoherent, it should stay as something used for only fun, and team 6x111 seemed to really enjoy making the song.

17959062905233126;"Unpopular opinion… I think I’m the only person on bookstagram who didn’t love this book. 🙈

Robin swift is taken from his home in Canton as a boy when a mysterious and aloof professor finds him with his dead mother and magically saves him from TB. He takes Robin on as his ward and grooms him for a prestigious language and translation college in Oxford. 

The college prepares translators to activate magical silver using different languages with sinister ends in mind.

There were interesting themes of colonialism and the ‘borrowing’ *read stealing, of other cultures. The way language was explored was probably what I enjoyed most. 

The problem for me was that I didn’t really care about the characters. I found a Robin to be annoyingly contrary and felt the other characters were a bit one dimensional. 

Things definitely picked up in intrigue and plot towards the end which helped gloss my overall experience but I won’t be rushing to reread this any time soon. 

It was fine but overall my feeling was just meh. I think the moral of this story is that I REALLY shouldn’t read hyped books. 

Don’t @ me!! 🫣

I REALLY wanted to like this book. And there were some things I did like. I liked that the narrative was very fluid, and that because it takes place over a significant period of time, reading it felt like a real journey. The writing is also beautiful. Lyrical and luxurious. ✨

Unfortunately, I just didn’t love it. I could appreciate the beauty in the story, and I could see why lots of readers found it special. 

But, dare I say it… I found it dull.

After a while, I lost interest in the slow moving story, and I didn’t enjoy making my way through a book that seemed like it had no direction.

𝗤𝗢𝗧𝗗: Which book are you eagerly waiting to start because you know you are going to love it?

Swipe ➡️ for Goodreads synopsis.

So many of my friends on bookstagram told me they loved this book, so if it’s on your TBR, you may want to stop reading my review because clearly, I’m in the minority. 😂 

I think my biggest issue is that I’ve read too many domestic thrillers, and this one is my least favorite. This book was published in 2016, so maybe everyone loved this one before the better domestic thrillers came out 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

There were no twists, and I was bored. 

I did like the past and present timeline and Millie (the sister).

‼️ 𝐒𝐏𝐎𝐈𝐋𝐄𝐑𝐒 𝐁𝐄𝐋𝐎𝐖 ‼️ - but not really because there was nothing to spoil.

I don’t know if the husband being an abuser was supposed to be shocking or a twist, but you could guess that from the synopsis…and it told you in like the 2nd chapter! This lead to it just being a story about Grace living with domestic violence, and I did not enjoy reading about his controlling ways. 

I was hoping there would be more secrets or something. I did appreciate the endingand how she escaped him, but I probably won’t be recommending this one. 

Happy Thursday! 💜Kaley

Like, not everyone has the money but they in fact want to learn and do some songs). Cutting anyone wings just for going in the only way they can to learn a new talent is really cruel. Let the future vocaloid producers start. And there is voices like Piko, Leon or Lola. Left they three forgotten seems more sad that just downloading them.

I really don't understand where this notion came from. The only similarities in design are her twin tails and if that's all it takes to be a miku rip off then why don't people say the same think about other synths like Tone Rion or Hitsuboku Kumi? She also sounds nothing like Miku, they have wildly different tones. So yea I really don't get it, you guys are sleeping on miss Zhi Zi she deserves more love 💗

⭐️ 

I did not enjoy any second of this book, but I kept reading because I’d seen so many great reviews. 🙈 Normally I would’ve just DNF’d but I had hope it would get better. Plus I was curious to see what happened!

Things that didn’t work for me:
•Rhys and Vivi had no chemistry or real connection
•The magic system had no explanation
•The explanation for the curse was predictable
•The way to end the curse was also predictable
•I was bored through the whole thing

Overall this seemed more like a fantasy book with romance added in just to support the curse plot. Don’t get me wrong, there’s steamy scenes, but they weren’t inherently romantic. I didn’t feel any attachment to any of the characters either.😩 There was no character development and the plot was underdeveloped.

""Motel Sun Down"" - Simone St. James

Lata osiemdziesiąte, Stany Zjednoczone, a pośród tej całej klimatycznej otoczki ON - złowieszczy motel, w którym rezydują żywi i martwi. Ze ścian wydobywa się stukot tajemniczego pochodzenia, światła migocą, przydrogowe neony lśnią niczym przecinające niebo błyskawice podczas najupiorniejszej burzy. Złowroga atmosfera małego miasteczka, podejrzani goście hotelowi i niespecjalnie normalne i bezpieczne zachowania przejezdnych. 

Dwudziestoletnia Viv podczas swojej podróży do Nowego Jorku natrafia na typa spod ciemnej gwiazdy z którym postanowiła zabrać się na stopa. Jego lepkie łapki powodują, iż dziewczyna w czas reflektuje i wysiada z auta, natrafiając przy tym na przydrożny motelik w Fell. Od ręki dostaje etat, podejmuje nocne zmiany, rezygnuje z dalszej podróży i pomimo nietypowych akcji w lobby hotelowym i nie do końca sprzyjającym warunkom (powtarzające się zjawiska paranormalne) kobieta postanawia zostać tu na dobre. Duchy jej nie zawadzają - ba! Stawia sobie za cel znalezienie winowajcy i dojście po nitce do kłębka, by uratować zagubione dusze z opresji.

Akcja prowadzona jest dwutorowo - drugą narratorką jest młodziutka Carly, która w latach obecnych zastanawia się, cóż stało się z jej zaginioną przed laty ciotką Viv. Jako pasjonatka true crime postanawia zabawić się w detektywa, wyrusza więc do Fell i prowadzi dochodzenie ocierając się o anomalie, podobne do tych, które towarzyszyły jej ciotce.

17933266334044888;"🙅🏻‍♀️ UNPOPULAR OPINION 🙅🏻‍♀️

It was super hard to get past the major theme in this book. There is a toxic mother/daughter relationship & that leads to a toxic marriage, but it’s played off as a cute “finding yourself” book. I just didn’t like the presentation of the relationships in this one at all. 

With that being said, keep reading for a more detailed review. This book did have things that I liked!

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

Synopsis: Katie’s mother dies and Katie spirals. She goes on a vacation that her and her mother had planned to go on together before she passed. Katie goes on this trip alone to find herself again and experience this place that her mother loved so much. While there, she discovers someone is there that seems oddly familiar… 

Review: This book is about Katie finding herself again. She is so lost without her mother that she doesn’t know how to go on. This book does accomplish the “finding yourself” aspect, & if you look past the toxicity, then it’s a good one! 

Katie isn’t the best main character, but I am happy with the ending of this book. It just doesn’t seem like there was a great flow from the beginning Katie to the end Katie, but that could also be my bias playing in. 

What I loved:

* Katie’s exploration of Positano. It made me really want to go there and explore the city. If I closed my eyes I could see exactly what Katie was doing and that was such a joy!

* The friends Katie made! They were all so wonderful and carefree. I’ve heard the citizens of Italy are like that overall, & I would love to go and experience that. 

* I enjoyed how Katie didn’t go to Italy and sit and wallow in her own self pity. She had an itinerary and even though it changed at times, she still went out and experienced this beautiful city. 

I probably wouldn’t recommend this book to my friends unless they already owned it or already planned to read it. Unfortunately, there are just better books out there that have the same theme as this one.

Only God knows when your family is ""complete.""

Psalm 139:16 says God sees your baby's UNFORMED body. (Note: this is not a pre mortal spiritual body). It also says all the days fashioned for your child were written down in God's book BEFORE one of them came to be.

Which means that only the eternal eyes of the Ancient One can know the new humans coming into existence. Only God knows if humanity, and your family, is finished growing.

And since God is the God of LIFE, CREATION, FERTILITY and HABITATION, there's a really good chance, if you're still fertile, God's not done growing your family (And even maybe if you're not).

Bottom line- there's actually no way, from our limited, finite, mortal viewpoint that we could know when God is absolutely done adding children to our family.

Trust him completely. He will provide. He will sustain. He will help take care of his children. 🤍";2022-07-14 11:59:36+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:22.289941+00:00;52;320;en

„ZWISCHEN WELTEN“
luchterhand_verlag 2023
🦢
Nur kurz ein paar Worte zu einem Buch, an dem sich offensichtlich gerade die Geister scheiden…
Leider konnte mich Juli Zeh mit ihrem neuen Roman, den sie zusammen mit Simon Urban geschrieben hat, so garnicht erreichen.
Für mich war vieles schlechterdings zu viel:
Die Fülle an Themen, die unbedingt angesprochen und diskutiert werden mussten -von Gendern über Klimawandel bis zur Ukraine war für jede(n) etwas dabei 
-, das Ergebnis war für mich dann oft zu plakativ und oberflächlich.
Zudem wirkten die beiden Hauptakteure Theresa und Stefan auf mich hölzern und voller Klischees, inklusive den verbalen Schlagabtauschs mit zu viel Moralkeule und erhobenem Zeigefinger.
🦢
„Unterleuten“ und „Über Menschen“ habe ich gefeiert, „Zwischen Welten“ musste ich irgendwann enttäuscht zur Seite legen.
Vielleicht konnte ich einfach mit dieser Art von „Satire“ nichts anfangen und bei euch trifft das Buch den richtigen Nerv??

A co mi się nie podobało?

1. Bohaterowie, których po prostu nie da się polubić. Nikogo.

2. Jeden zwrot akcji, który oczywisty jest już od drugiego rozdziału.
(jeden co prawda mnie zaskoczył i tu mały plus całej książki, ale nie na tyle, by uznać ją za dobrą)

3. Totalnie niewciągająca historia. Przez pierwszą część oprócz szalonych przemyśleń głównej bohaterki, nic więcej się nie dzieje

4. Prosty język i pierwszoosobowa narracja, za którą nie przepadam oraz retrospekcje pojawiające się znikąd, które często mnie nudziły, podobnie jak rozważania bohaterek nie prowadzące do niczego

5. Brak zbudowanego napięcia, tajemnicy, mroku; przynajmniej ja niczego takiego nie czułam

5. Idiotyczne zakończenie z serii ""mogę uciec i wezwać pomoc, ale wrócę by skonfrontować się z mordercą""

Podsumowując książka nie sprawdziła mi się nawet jako prosta, niewymagająca rozrywka. Doszłam do wniosku, że za stara już chyba jestem na te wszystkie podobne do siebie thrillery. Może gdybym przeczytała ją kilka lat temu, zrobiłaby na mnie większe wrażenie, a tak no cóż.. szukam w książkach czegoś innego.

Firstly, it's always a pride to play for your country's national team and what's more special than that is Winning a Trophy with your National Team. So when these so called Friendly Tournaments are giving an opportunity to any player or team to lift a trophy with their respective country - then these tournaments need to hold a prestigious position in itself.

Instead of expanding the world cup or euros to more teams and damaging its history & integrity, these governing bodies should focus on improving these other international tournaments, should make it better in every possible way. The concept of Nations League can be used by fifa and they can create something similar with all the 200+ countries in the world, having different level of divisions, leagues and groups.

⭐️⭐️💫

Love and Other Words by Christina Lauren 

Okay friends… I’m sorry. 

I really did not like this one and the more I think about it, the less I like it sooo… here’s the review. 

Ultimately, I think I can sum things up by saying we spent way too much time in that dang closet for me to believe in Macy and Elliot’s connection…

I love a second chance romance / friends to lovers hybrid but I need to feel INVESTED in the characters and their love story in order for it to work. 

The majority of the story was spent doing the dreaded “will they, won’t they” dance, with a devastating break-up looming! We quite literally missed out on all of the best parts of a romance novel - the parts where they are together and BLISSFULLY HAPPY?? I wanted more!!!

I wanted more butterfly inducing moments!!! 

I wanted more time with the hilarious Petropoulos family and Macy’s sweet Dad!!!

I wanted to see Macy and Elliot growing together and falling in love in the real world!!!

But most of all… I wanted some of the more sensitive issues surrounding their breakup to be handled with the respect they deserved and to not be essentially glossed over. 

In summary, I recommend you read The Unhoneymooners or Josh and Hazel’s Guide to Not Dating instead! 😂

Thanks to kayimreading sipsnstories and lifewithprinceman for reading this one with me! I loved all of our nightly chats and I can’t wait for our next read! 💕

No sé hasta que punto es una opinión impopular porque he hablado con algunas personas y más o menos todas coincidimos 🙄.

De esta saga se ha hablado mucho (pero MUCHO MUCHO) y en mi opinión este libro no es para tanto. 

Es un libro bastante plano y vacio de acción, solo hay dos momentos claves (por lo menos para mí) donde se pone interesante la narrativa: la trama del rey Fulke y al final cuando aparece el comandante.

Literalmente que no pasa nada en más de la mitad del libro. Muy, muy, muy introductorio. 

Ha habido momentos que no tenían fin y eran muy aburridos, menos mal que algún personaje secundario nos ha dado unas cuantas lineas para refrescar la mente. 

Tenemos muchos pensamientos de la protagonista que dependiendo del momento van cambiando de un extremo al otro. Supongo que es el inicio de su evolución.

El rey Midas... Pues eso, un señoro.

Si la autora queria representar la toxicidad que hay entre los dos personajes desde luego que lo ha conseguido.

Es un mundo bastante extremo dependiendo en que clase social hayas nacido y de qué trabajes. Hay comentarios y momentos bastante desagradables (yo ya sabía lo que me iba a encontrar pero aún así es algo que te choca).

Le voy a dar una oportunidad al segundo porque quiero descubrir porque a tanta gente la ha gustado esta saga, pero ahora mismo no está entre mis prioridades como lectura.

💀 ""Pamięć ciała. Przemoc seksualna, morderstwo i kara."" - Alex Marzano - Lesnevich

""Pamięć ciała"" jest kolejnym tytułem, który został wydany pod koniec ubiegłego roku w ramach Serii Amerykańskiej.  Seria ta charakteryzuje się ciężkim bagażem emocjonalnym, obciążającą psychicznie tematyką, dlatego też z reguły takowe lektury rozkładam sobie w czasie. 

Do tej pozycji robiłam sporo podejść, niejednokrotnie odkładałam i w międzyczasie wciągnęłam X innych książek. Styl pisania autorki okazał się być dla mnie dość nieprzyswajalny, chaotyczny i  co gorsza - momentami podejrzanie wyimaginowany (często powtarza ""wyobrażam sobie, że było tak i tak/ wyobrażam sobie, że miała taką sukienkę jak moja babcia"")... 🤔

Autorka pokusiła się na spisanie historii zamordowanego trzynastolatka Jeremy'ego Guillory'ego przez dwudziestoparoletniego pedofila - Ricky'ego Langley'a, przeplatając ich losy z własnymi. Wprawdzie jej drogi w pewnym momencie przetną się z tą, która powinna była zostać (moim zdaniem) główną aleją. Ba - ja się spodziewałam, że będzie to wręcz droga szybkiego ruchu, jak nie autostrada. 

Nie zrozumcie mnie źle - szanuję fakt, iż Pani Marzano-Lesnevich otworzyła się przed czytelnikami i podzieliła swoimi dziecięcymi traumami, które doprowadziły ją do miejsca, w którym się znalazła. Dała upust swoim własnym emocjom i wyznała wszystko, co spotkało ją w dzieciństwie...

17985363028516245;"It's impossible to scroll through much of booksta before coming across It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover. If it weren't so popular I wouldn't have felt the need to read it, but here I am.

I didn't like this book, and if this is your favourite and reading a highly critical review is not something you want to do, feel free to scroll past this whole post.

Firstly, what I liked is the general depiction and exploration of domestic abuse and its cyclic nature and the ending was decent too. Angry lily and the conversation with her mum made me at least feel I gained something from this book. 

What I didn't like was most of everything else, including character names. The character names are odd, and the writing is juvenile and littered with clichés in lieu of dialogue that is actually engaging. This is also the cringiest book I've ever read, with frequent pauses on my part while I rolled my eyes. The use of journal entries (addressed to Ellen DeGeneres no less 🤢) felt weak - flashbacks to Lily's memory of living in an abusive household and her relationship with Atlas surely would have sufficed.

From the start, Ryle gave me the ick and Hoover gave literally no reasons to the reader to believe in their romance other than lust, and because he looks good in scrubs 🙄. Maybe them never going on an actual date is kind of the point (🚩) but i think this story would've been more effective if their supposed love was actually developed and had weight to it. 

This book also had not so subtle undertones of praising wealth and  a 'pull yourself up by your bootstraps' vibe - capitalistic propaganda isn't something I want to read. on the subject of subtlely, this book had nearly none of it which isn't a problem in itself, but i don't generally like that.

I think there shouldve been a bit more commentary on weaponised childhood trauma, for example pointing out that lily has childhood trauma but isn't abusive and manipulative like Ryle. 

I genuinely dreaded picking this (audio) book up each time and I didn't find it engaging at all. I can still see how others could love this but it wasn't for me at all.

17967030626314212;"So last night was pretty hellish. I had a 6 hour flight from Vancouver to Honolulu with no food, the car rental place had a 45min queue, didn't have my car and said minimum hour wait, and then sent me to another desk which did not exist. I gave up and got a taxi after two hours of walking the airport, looking for it. There were no people to ask, anywhere. The airport is tiny.

The hotel I was booked into was in a part of town which felt just like Hastings St in Van (#ifyouknowyouknow). 

I ended up changing hotels after an hour to somewhere comfortable and safe, which helped a bit, and then I got some food into me, which helped a bit more. 

This morning, in the sunlight, things feel a lot better. Honolulu is nice, but #unpopularopinion, it's essentially just the Gold Coast with more Americans and a staggering number of homeless (wtf America, this is a rich country, this should not be happening). 

So I'm sitting under a palm tree in the sun, and it is pleasant, but in future I'll keep my money in Australia and go explore the places up north I actually want to see. 

As my dad said: I'm ""probably the only person in the world who doesn't like Hawaii"". I don't HATE it today like I did last night but yeah. Not feeling that island vibe. Whatever, I'll enjoy my last day of downtime before kiddos and back-to-school prep.

Selen vs popular opinion 🤷🏻‍♀️

I am sorry, friends. Truly. I don’t understand how my favorite romance elements come together and my star rating still falls short.. 😢

Plot: 
1. Small town - I failed to picture the town. 
2. Slow burn - not fair to compare but I read great ones. Mariana Zapata's books being my favorites.
3. Family drama - felt so pushed

Bonus:
4. Books - count me always in for books about books
5. Checklists - my life revolves around them. 

Unfortunately, bonus points couldn't save the plot for me. I just couldn’t get over the fact that all 3 leading characters are failing to deal with their sh** and running circles around each other.

Daughter Of The Moon Goddess - She Lynn Tan
⭐⭐⭐

From what I've seen my opinion of this one isn't hugely popular. I have seen people ranting and raving about this book yet for me it fell flat.

I liked the story, despite it being very predictable. I saw the twists coming ages in advance.

There were a few quite large time jumps where we seemed to go from the main character being friends with  the others to suddenly being in love with them. I prefer to see the progression of the relationships so the building up of them(or lack of) was a huge miss for me. Also the Xingying did my head in to be honest. There was just something about her that grated on me 🙊

I really enjoyed the magical element and there was so much going on throughout the book which was nice.

Overall I liked the book and will read the next instalment when it comes out but it won't be one I'll be rushing to read.

I have some beautiful items that relate to this book! And the book itself is absolutely stunning 😍

I don't think it would even matter if they were just one single vocaloid . Similar goes for Kanon and Anon (but i don't really like their designs sorry 😔) . The reason Rin and Len worked is because Len was created to be Rin's ""masculine"" counterpart , so that people could use a high-pitched male crypton vocaloid . Meika Hime and Mikoto also worked because they were made for different genres (hime for kawaii/cute songs and Mikoto for cool songs) and their voices are distinctive from one another .

17941226540584195;"""Spełnione życzenia"" to książka, której akcja dzieje się w Wigilię. Jeden dzień z życia wielu osób, z których każda ma inne marzenia. Piękna okładka sugeruje miłą literaturę obyczajową w zimowym klimacie. Ale czy to na pewno właściwa książka do świątecznego czytania?

Książka mną wstrząsnęła. Spodziewałam się ciepłej opowieści, z dziewczynką z okładki w głównej roli. Coś jak ""Dziewczynka z ciasteczkami"" Ewy Formelli. Niestety, im dalej brnęłam w losy bohaterów, tym byłam coraz bardziej rozczarowana tym, w jakim kierunku potoczyła się ta książka. A przecież ""Święta do wynajęcia"" Karoliny Wilczyńskiej tak mi się podobały!

Trudne przypadki historii ludzkich, ich niespełnione pragnienia, które realizują się, ale często kosztem innych. Zamiast nieco ckliwej opowieści mamy thriller psychologiczny czy też kryminał, w którym trup ścieli się gęsto. Nie mam nic przeciwko fabule opartej na realiach życia, ale tutaj nagromadziły się same najgorsze możliwe przypadki. Tak jakby los chciał wszystkich boleśnie doświadczyć i zobaczyć jak sobie z tym poradzą. W tym ujęciu okładkowa dziewczynka może kojarzyć się z aniołem zagłady. 

To, w jaki sposób spełniają się życzenia poszczególnych bohaterów przypomniało mi opowiadanie Marty Kisiel ""Pierwsze słowo"". Tutaj podobnie owo 'pierwsze słowo do dziennika', wypowiedziane, czasami nieświadomie, życzenie spełnia się, ale z konsekwencjami pragnień postacie muszą mierzyć się do końca, czasami nie tylko swojego, życia. 

""Spełnione życzenia"" to nie jest zła książka, niemniej z pewnością nie wpisuje się w ramy świątecznych obyczajówek. Zmusza do zadumy nad losem, życiem, relacjami z bliskimi. Pokazuje mroczne strony ludzi. Ale jak na wigilijną historię brakuje tu optymizmu i radości towarzyszącej świętom. Niewielu bohaterów ma wizję lepszej przyszłości. Ja po tej lekturze z chęcią przeczytałabym natomiast kryminał czy thriller autorstwa pani Karoliny.

📚 Book Review📚: Greetings from Asbury Park by Daniel H. Turtel 
📅 Pub Date: April 5, 2022

Yet another unpopular opinion for me today… I had a hard time getting into it, partially because of the large number of characters. The POV changed every chapter and while I like to see different sides of the story, there was no way to distinguish whose perspective each chapter was being told from. 

I do like family dramas that are heavy on the drama and boy did this meet that requirement. It’s very dark subjects with just a small touch of hope. The writing is descriptive and at times lyrical and beautiful, but the dialog was often choppy and stilted. I felt like I needed more character development, and that at times I was missing the motivation for why things were being said or done. There are some major trigger warnings on this one as well, that I’d recommend you check out on Story Graph prior to picking this one up. If you are looking for a darker tone family drama that deals with some serious issues, you might want to give this one a try!

Thanks to blackstonepublishing for the #gifted ARC. Greetings from Asbury Park was just published this week on April 5.

It is a strong and energetic sounding young female vocal, an example of voice acting. The Una vocal was fairly beginner friendly and high quality, also being one of Internet Co., Ltd.'s highest quality voicebanks. This voicebank is ideal for rock music and power ballads.

I’m not one of those people who hates Valentine’s Day. I know, I know. Call me “crazy”. It is actually one of my favorite holidays and that includes all the years I’ve been single! No, I don’t care about chocolate and roses nor support Hallmark, but I do adore a holiday that celebrates telling the people in our life (whoever they are) that they mean something to us.

We didn’t have any specific plans that day, something that would have once brought me so much stress and anxiety, but these days “no plan” brings the opposite. Peace. Joy. Adventure. Fun. Connection.

I lost track a long time ago with how many waterfalls we have hiked to together but this one was magical.

And with no dinner plans at all, we divinely ended up sitting at a table for 2 on the beach with a candle, red tablecloth, sipping wine and eating fresh, local seafood, listening to live saxophone playing over the waves. A day for the books and one of my most favorite.

Many would attribute such a perfect day to being far from home, on a tropical island, but this single day would have meant just the same by a waterfall or beach at home in Maine winter. And that’s how I know it’s not the place or the thing or the holiday or the weather, but the person.

This journey towards healing past wounds wouldn’t be as impactful without him. To feel a sense of ease in my body and Self while with him only makes my heart smile.

I say all that not to make you feel a certain way about how you spent Valentines, but to share what’s possible to those who are starting to wonder if it is. Because I had a time I really wondered too. And also to say that, while I hope each of you felt something special that day, at the very least I hope you can begin to try and see those days on the calendar that you write off as “stupid”, as an opportunity to make it about the people or the person, whether partner, best friend or family…not the place or the thing or the holiday or the weather.

During the testing before release, producer hanyuu maigo said that ci flower is better for background vocals. V flower is better as a lead vocal. Ci flower has a stable autopitch tuning and her default singing is calm. V flower is (kinda) expressive even with no tuning (or that's just me). Basically, Ci flower completes V flower. It's ok if you don't like Ci flower, V flower is still sold on the vocaloid store for around the same price (v flower is 11 000 yen, Ci flower is 10 780 yen but whatever). Or if you want the Cevio experience with an androgynous powerful voice, just get ChisA jpn who is free.

QoTD: What is the first book you started reading in 2023? 

How is this a thriller?? Disappointed in the author after reading this (I loved Gone Girl)....

The only thing I liked in this book is the tumultuous relationship of the protagonist with her mother. It is apparent that her mother is abusive to Camille as well as her half-sister Amma. I like stories which focus on strained parent-child dynamics. But we were told things rather than being shown. We are told the background of the mother from side characters and such. Even Camille's past is told to us by her instead of being shown (by way of flashbacks, dreams etc.). It felt as if we were just being shown the toxic and abusive aspects of the family instead of there being any narrative to the characters or the story.

I didn't like how the character of Amma was portrayed. First of all, why are they calling her Amma? Her name's Amity so if they wanted to shorten it, could have called her Amy. Amma is ""mother"" in many languages. Maybe it's a conscious choice of the author but it feels weird considering the characters (and the author) is white. Amma is described to be the IT GIRL of the town; rich, pretty, popular, she is essentially Regina George, who bullies all the girls and steals their boyfriends. I HATED how often the book kept mentioning about a THIRTEEN YEAR OLD'S boobs and panties. Every time Amma was on page the author had to make sure that the readers know she is a girl who does not act her age, and I get that. But why do you have to mention her big boobs and thongs!? She is A CHILD!

I have discussed spoilers in my Goodreads review. 

My rating: 2.5/5 ⭐

17986032907842649;"⭐️ 𝘏𝘢𝘮𝘯𝘦𝘵 by Maggie O’Farrell⭐️

A young woman with a kestrel, feared by the town because of her gifts, and her brothers’ Latin tutor, who dreams of a better life, fall in love and devise a plan to ensure they will be allowed to marry. Meanwhile, in Stratford-upon-Avon, a girl suddenly becomes ill with a fever, strange buboes forming on her neck. Her twin brother runs for help, unable to find anyone at home, he tries the town to no avail. Their mother is off tending to her herbs, and their father is in London for work, unaware that one of their children will soon be gone forever.

This is a reimagining of Shakespeare’s life and the loss of one of his children - I’ll leave you to guess the one. We never find out the name of the father, but if you know anything about history or literature, it’s obvious from just the title, and description of a playwright with a hoop earring.

I first started reading this book in late 2020 (or 2021 I honestly can’t remember) and ended up DNF at 50%. I thought it had something to do with my mood at the time, so decided to give it a go again this year because it does have so many good reviews, some by my fave booktubers. I really did try. It was just so painfully average for me. I know I’m the minority in this, but it was so overly verbose, slow and honestly I found myself a little bored. The premise of the story was interesting and I think this could’ve been great, but I did not enjoy the writing style and was not engaged by it, nor did it illicit any emotional response from me, despite its tragic nature.

⭐️2.5/5

We wrześniu kupiłam w promocji polecają przez wszystkich historię #oskaripaniróża i od razu ją przeczytałam 🌱
Nie był to długi tytuł, więc lektura nie zajęła mi zbyt dużo czasu. 🌱
Przyznam, że trochę bałam się tej lektury, bo nieczęsto sięgam po książki z silnym motywem choroby. 🌱
""Oskar i Pani Róża"" to bestseller i wiem, że wiele osób omawiała go także w szkole w ramach lekcji języka polskiego, jednak w moim gimnazjum ta pozycja nie znalazła się na liście lektur. 🌱
Wiele osób pisało na bookstagramie o tym, jaka to świetna książka i w końcu uległam pokusie sprawdzenia, jakie zrobi na mnie wrażenie. 🌱
Niestety dosyć mocno się pomyliłam, sądząc, że ta lektura mną wstrząśnie. 🌱
Bałam się morza łez, wylanego nad jej stronami, a nie uroniłam podczas czytania nawet jednej. 🌱
Zupełnie nie przypadł mi do gustu moralizatorski, chociaż specyficznie ukryty, ton opowieści, który zazwyczaj mi nie przeszkadza. 🌱
Nie jestem osobą religijną, a równocześnie jestem bardzo wyczulona na cierpienie innych osób, związane z przewlekłą chorobą. 🌱
Zachowanie bohaterki tej historii zupełnie nie wpisuje się w przyjmowane przeze mnie normy moralne. 🌱
Postrzegam je raczej jako sprzedawanie komuś pięknie brzmiących kłamstw, niż wspieranie go i pełną szczerość, na którą zasługiwał chłopiec jako pełnoprawna jednostka w sytuacji bez wyjścia. 🌱
Poza wątpliwościami, dotyczącymi wydźwięku moralnego tej książki, w moich myślach pojawiła się też niezbyt pozytywna refleksja, dotycząca stylu autora. 🌱
Nie była to narracja, która w jakikolwiek sposób by mnie poruszyła. 🌱🌱🌱
Oczywiście jest to tylko MOJA OPINIA i w żaden sposób nie chcę dyskredytować wielbicieli #ericemmanuelschmitt 🌱
Dobrej nocy, Kochani❗🌱🌱🌱

🐾Janina è una sessantenne con qualche rotella fuori posto: vive in un luogo impervio, preferisce la compagnia degli animali a quella degli uomini, per i quali inventa nomi stravaganti, e crede che l'astronomia sia in grado di spiegare gli eventi del mondo, spingendosi quasi a predirli.

🐾A rompere questa sua bolla ovattata, un giorno nella cittadina iniziano a susseguirsi morti improvvise e lei decide di indagare, convinta che si tratti di una rivolta della natura contro l'uomo. 

""𝐍𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐚 𝐟𝐨𝐭𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐢𝐚 𝐬𝐢 𝐯𝐞𝐝𝐞𝐯𝐚 𝐭𝐮𝐭𝐭𝐨 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐞. 𝐋𝐚 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐚 𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐃𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐨, [...] 𝐂'𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐨 𝐝𝐞𝐠𝐥𝐢 𝐮𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐢 𝐢𝐧 𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐞, 𝐢𝐧 𝐟𝐢𝐥𝐚, 𝐞 𝐝𝐚𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐢 𝐚 𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐨 𝐬𝐮𝐥𝐥'𝐞𝐫𝐛𝐚 𝐠𝐢𝐚𝐜𝐞𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐨 𝐬𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐛𝐞𝐥𝐥'𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐥𝐞 𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐠𝐥𝐢𝐞 𝐝𝐞𝐠𝐥𝐢 𝐀𝐧𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐢.

🐾Vi avevo anticipato che la mia sarebbe stata una #unpopularopinion ed ora vi spiego perché.

🐾Ammetto senz'altro che la storia è psichedelica, la protagonista fuori di testa,  il messaggio onorevole e la scrittura fluida, e che forse questo è il motivo del clamore nonché del Premio Nobel del 2018 -- oltre ovviamente ad un rispettivo gusto personale.

🐾Tuttavia, io ho avuto un problema: per tutto il tempo ho sentito una domanda risuonare nella mente ""Ma quindi...???""

🐾Questa sorta di impiutezza, mista a inconcludenza continua, ha distolto a più riprese la mia attenzione dalla storia -- senza contare che avevo capito il finale dopo neanche 30 pagine -- minando inesorabilmente il mio giudizio in merito.

🐾Questo perché i capitoli sono un insieme di riflessioni ed eventi sconnessi e prolissi, un flusso di coscienza inconsistente della protagonista, che tenta di creare, a parer mio senza riuscirci, una sorta di suspense sulla verità di quanto accaduto e sulle ragioni che ne sono alla base.

Risultato? È intelligente ma non si applica. Peccato.

17973227582031296;"Unpopular opinion: I don’t want to be the best version of myself every day. I want to be a good person every day.

 Es gibt ca. eine Million verschiedene Lifehacks, Trends, Bücher und Ratschläge, die dir erklären was du zu tun hast um besser zu werden, höher, schneller weiter zu kommen. That Girl, Hustle Culture, Personal Development, Lucky Girl Syndrom und so weiter. Aber besser worin eigentlich? Besser im Besser werden? Ich will nicht sagen, dass Coaches keine Daseinsberechtigung haben, im Gegenteil bin ich Überzeugt, dass es unfassbar wertvoll ist, mit einem Coach oder Therapeuten individuell an Zielen und Herausforderungen zu arbeiten. Mit einer Person, die eine fundierte Ausbildung hat und individuell auf diene Bedürfnisse eingeht. Was ich Kritisch sehe, sind die Ratschläge und Methoden, die ungefiltert sämtliche social media Plattformen überfluten. Diese pauschalisierten Angebote gehen nicht auf dich als Individuum und deine Bedürfnisse und Umstände ein. Nicht jeder Mensch ist dazu geboren um 5 Uhr morgens aufzustehen und das ist auch völlig in Ordnung. Auch wenn das häufig in den Selfhelp und Motivationsvideos den Anschein macht, bist du kein schlechterer Mensch und auch nicht direkt weniger produktiv, wenn du nicht zum 5am Club gehörst. Ich frage mich immer wieder, warum diese Selfhelp Bewegung so versessen darauf ist sich selbst ständig zu verbessern und immer noch produktiver und noch krasser zu werden. Ich frage mich ob es nicht eigentlich genug wäre, einfach ein guter Mensch zu sein, freundlich, anderen gegenüber respektvoll und hilfsbereit und sich über den eigenen Abdruck auf der Welt (im ökologischen und im gesellschftlichen Sinne) immer mal wieder bewusst zu werden.

17966265964586638;"⬇️My Victorious “unpopular” opinions: 

Victorious would have been better if it was more like a teen drama, and wasn’t so episodic and focus on the comedy.
- The characters are way too interesting for them to be limited to the comedy. It seems like the writers were kinda limiting them to only comedy because that’s what they’re used to. And they probably wanted to replicate iCarly’s success, but that comedy and episodic nature worked for that show, because the characters weren’t supposed to grow. While in Victorious, the lack of character growth was holding it back, it should have been story driven. People love the potential of Victorious, not the actual show.

Andre liking Jade should have became a storyline, not just one singular episode.
- Jade Gets Crushed is my favorite episode of Victorious. This goes with my point of how much potential these characters had. They just needed to change the dynamic of the show a bit. Andre liking Jade could’ve been the perfect start to that.

A relationship between Tori and Andre should have been tried out at least once.
- Adding on to my last point of Jade and Andre. Imagine if Jade and Andre get together, Andre would be too busy to just stop his life and do everything for Tori. And his absence can make Tori realizes she has feelings him. But she doesn’t want to say anything, because she doesn’t want it to seem like she likes every guy Jade is with. Jade has become a lot nicer to her too, so she doesn’t want to ruin her happiness.

The amount of drama this show could have had would’ve been so good. I feel like if they went a more story-driven route, the show wouldn’t have lost as much viewership by seasons 3-4 because fans would be dedicated to stay for the story.

Guten Morgen Reader,

welchen Hype seit ihr zuletzt nicht verfallen?

Heute habe ich für euch mein Feedback zu Crush von #tracywolff aus dem dtv_verlag 

Meinung
Eigentlich sollten diese Werke genau meinen Geschmack wiederspiegeln. Eine Akademia mit übernatürlichen Schülern, Spannung, ein Liebesdreieck, Humor und dunkle Geheimnisse. Doch nachdem mich bereits der zweite Teil ernüchterter als gedacht zurück ließ hatte ich schon die Befürchtung, dass es mir mit der Fortzsetzung ggf. ähnlich ergehen würde. 

Was soll ich sagen - es ist einfach nicht mein Buch. Inhaltlich wurde mir gegen Ende hin ein Abenteuer geboten, welches ich nicht mehr missen wollen würde, aber dazwischen verlor sich für mich persönlich der Fokus immer mehr aus den Augen. Die Romanze nahm im Vergleich zur Fantasie sehr viel Raum ein und ich hatte immer mehr und mehr das Gefühl, dass genau diese schlichtweg mehr Platz benötigen würde um vollumfänglich auf mich einwirken zu können.

Besonders zu Beginn zog sich alles doch deutlich in die Länge. Es fühlte sich an wie Kaugummi und ich fing an, je mehr Seiten voranschritten eher lustlos an der Story zu lesen. Die Dialoge kamen hier jedoch defintiv nicht zu kurz - gefühlt-endlose-Streitgespräche zwischen Grace, Jaxon und Hudson sorgten bei mir für einen leichten Nerv-Pegel. 

Diese Emotion zog sich bis ca zum zweiten Drittel, danach nahm die Story an Fahrt auf und ich bekam den erhofften Adrenalin-Schub. Doch egal wie ich das Blatt drehe oder wende, die Reihe und ich sind einfach nicht füreinander gemacht. 

Fazit
Für mich war die Fortsetzung langatmig, das Liebesdreieck nahm zu viel Raum ein und die Fantasie rückte immer mehr in den Hintergrund. Aus diesem Grund 2.5 von 5 Sternen

17936541112729771;"CLEARED FOR SEX DOESN’T = READY FOR SEX

If the final act of making love is having a baby, then that means that POSTPARTUM = NEW BEGINNING.

Act ONE.

**Reconnecting intimately is so much more than you’re vagina being ready.**

➡️Did you have a traumatic birth?
➡️Is there bitterness around sleepless nights or a tough crying newborn?
➡️Stress around going back to work?
➡️PPD?

This is a very SHORT list of reasons to pause and chat about together. Reconnecting from a position of PEACE is the way forward.

BEING READY FOR SEX IS MORE THAN THE MOTHERS BODY BEING PHYSICALLY READY. 

Time is irrelevant. 6 weeks or 52 weeks.

HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU’RE READY?

You’re *POSSIBLY* ready after: 

❤️You’ve talked about and processed your birth together. (Perhaps seeking outside help)

❤️You have expressed to one another your fears/desires about reconnecting physically (women need this after the work of releasing a baby - in light of her healing).

❤️It is emotionally, spiritually and physically SAFE to proceed - (are sexual integrity and prayer present?)

Mama LB believes that after having a baby, you aren’t just “resuming sex” with your spouse.

You’re connecting for the FIRST TIME as new parents (i don’t care if it’s your first baby or sixth).....it’s the mark of a NEW season! You’ve never been in this season before!

It’s so tender and special.

I’ve been ready at 4 weeks - I’ve been ready at 8 months. Each addition is its own time.

The more reverence and recognition we give PP SEX - the more connection in marriage - the more PEACE we have in our home.

If you’re not ready yet - that’s ok. It’s not a problem.

Time is a relative measurement.

Peace is a better one. (See my PP SEX highlight)

House of Sky and Breath - Sarah J Mass

⭐️⭐️⭐️.5

📣Spoiler!!!!📣

So. I’m going to be controversial here, but… was anybody else left a bit disappointed by this? 

I love Sarah j Maas, but I just felt this book could have been so much more. I felt it was just led too much by the sexual attraction and the need to include sex! Love a bit of smut, but I do like it to be relevant and add to the story. On this occasion, it took away from it. I also got a bit sick of the word mate and alphahole at every opportunity.

Despite this, the actual plot driven aspects I really enjoyed. Though some were predictable. I kind of guessed it with the Hind, pretty early on. 

And the crossover! I don’t know how to feel about this yet 😂

_______________________ 

Note : 2,5⭐️ 

_______________________ 
Ce livre n’est plus à présenter, étant une référence dans la fantasy YA.
La saga est décriée par la chronique et les lecteurs, recommandée par moults copines lectrices : je me devais de tenter l’aventure.
∙
Mais…. ça ne l’a pas fait.
Malgré ma persévérance à le terminer, à vouloir comprendre l’engouement, je me suis faite une raison : cette saga n’est pas pour moi. Ce n’est pas un mauvais livre mais je le conseillerai davantage à de jeunes lecteurs ou à ceux découvrant la fantasy mais pas aux aguerries du genre.

Une impression de lassitude et de vide m’a saisie tout au long du roman.
Je pense que mon manque d’intérêt réside dans le fait que je ne sois pas novice dans ce genre littéraire, trouvant de facto le tout insipide.
Bien que ce soit du YA, j’ai trouvé la narration un peu pauvre, presque infantilisante (trop jeunesse par rapport à l’âge des protagonistes). Elle ne m’a pas convaincue dans son exécution et dans la fibre sentimentale.
En effet, aucun attachement ne s’est fait sentir quant aux personnage. Bien que Jude soit décrite comme une jeune femme forte et indépendante, ses actions étaient en contradiction et puériles, me la rendant agaçante. Cardan (le fameux Prince Cruel t’as capté 👀) n’est au final pas très présent, agissant presque en personnage secondaire dans ce premier tome et ses agissements ne sont pas aussi décadents qu’on nous porte à croire.

L’univers est cependant très riche, fantasmagorique. L’auteure en fait un hymne à la Nature.
Mais tous ces éléments sont survolés, peu exploités, donnant au récit qui manque de consistance pour vraiment tenir le lecteur avide.

Si mon avis semblait sortir du lot en le terminant, mon unpopular opinion s’est avéré plus généralisé (merci cinivre pour ton sondage) #jenesuisplusseule 😂

17999604658617329;Ok mixed. So this was a good story and I can see why it’s liked. I have beef though. As a Christian - it got VERY annoying bc EVERY SINGLE “religious” person in the book was a pedo, liar, didn’t believe in God, cheater, scammer, etc. Be like me writing a book and making every atheist a horrible person. It’s just not realistic. Yes the church sometimes makes God look bad- it’s full of humans. But this just got to the point where I was like… SERIOUSLY??? 🙄🙄🙄 So no more from this author for me.

This one didn’t work for me at all.  I don’t enjoy miscommunication or lack of communication as a plot device.  This was heavy on the latter.  For 2 smart people both Levi & Bee were beyond annoyingly stupid when it comes to people.  Not to say they both didn’t have reasons for why they were the way they were but seriously, I didn’t need half the book to be all about their assumptions about each other.  I’d rather have watched their new relationship form rather than focusing on their perceptions.  Also I felt like the first ¼ of the book was spent trying to prove how smart Bee is/was and I’m not sure it was actually relevant to the story.  I mean, yes it was somewhat relevant but not the extent it was explained.

I didn’t get emotionally attached to either character; and it was this more than anything which caused the rating.  I need that connection.

I know so many people loved this one; and I always feel like I am missing something when I don’t get the same feeling from reading a book as others, but that is what makes reading and the book community so great.  You don’t have to agree.

#QOTD what is one book that you didn’t like when you were finished and maybe threw across the room only to have a book bestie say to you well…what if?

#aotd for me it was Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.  I threw that sucker across the room when Snape broke my heart and one of my book besties said “well, what if” and I had to read the whole damn book again from that perspective.

18026831524453172;"Ascoltare questa canzone mi ha invasa di tantissime sensazioni... sto per dire francamente ciò che penso e so già che a qualcuno non piacerà. 
Il pezzo è indiscutibilmente bello, musicalmente ricco, testualmente esprime un romanticismo maturo e non banale ma... c'è un ""MA""... 
Come quando cucini un piatto complesso e che ti è venuto pure con un bell'aspetto ma l'odore è strano: come se un ingrediente fosse sbagliato o andato a male. 
Questa canzone è così: bella come la torta di mele di tua nonna ma odora di... Sanremo. 
Non mi lancerò in teorie cospirazionistiche sul fatto che questo potesse essere il pezzo che volevano presentare al festival: non lo sappiamo, non ci è dato saperlo e non è una ipotesi che intendo fomentare.
Ciò che voglio dire è che questa canzone somiglia ad altre canzoni sentite sul palco della kermesse ligure. Intendiamoci: ricorda quelle belle che sono passate, quelle che più ho apprezzato e che vincevano fino a qualche anno fa. Prima dell'avvento di sonorità particolari come quelle di Mahmood, il Volo e Maneskin, questa canzone ricorda piuttosto alcune ballate romantiche Sanremesi degli anni '90 tipo la bellissima: ""Vorrei incontrarti fra 100 anni"" di Ron e Tosca.
Ci tengo a precisare che non sto dicendo che la canzone non mi piaccia. Mi piace, solo che non sa di nuovo: sa di ricerca di approvazione e io spero che i nostri ragazzi, per definizione ""liberi da sempre"" , ne siano convinti.
Poi va detto che dobbiamo ancora sentire tutto il resto che spero sia un intero album. Sarei davvero immensamente felice di stringere fra le mani un nuovo disco dei Sonohra!

17887968542681242;"Ach, ich bin zwiegespalten und das könnte jetzt ein bisschen unpopulär werden.
„Jahre mit Martha“ von Martin Kordic ist hier ja sehr gelobt, um nicht zu sagen gehypt, worden.
Und vorweg: ganz vieles kann ich nachvollziehen, es liest sich ganz wunderbar, so leichtfüßig geschrieben, fast im Plauderton, scheinbar eine reine Liebesgeschichte - und so ganz nebenbei schleicht sich unterschwellig dann ein anderes Thema ein.
Die Geschichte von Zejlko Drazenko Kovacevic, genannt Jimmy. Kind bosnischer Immigranten, dem der Weg im deutschen Schulsystem nicht leicht gemacht wird, nichts mit Chancengleichheit, dem geraten wird, vom Gymnasium abzugehen und eine Ausbildung zum Gärtner zu machen. Der dann seinen Weg macht, studiert. Dies alles auch mit Hilfe von Frau Gruber, Martha - Universitätsprofessorin, viele Jahre älter, mit der ihn eine langjährige Liebesbeziehung verbindet, die früh beginnt. Bei mir schlich sich da sehr schnell Mrs. Robinson in meine Gedanken.
Und doch hat mich etwas gestört: eine Verharmlosung der Beziehung zu Frau Gruber, die ich als toxisch (für beide Seiten) empfand. 
Und leider entbehrt für mich das Ende des Buches nicht einer gewissen Ironie, bei der ich mich frage, ist sie gewollt?
Alles in allem gut geschrieben, gut zu lesen, aber für mich nicht das erwartete Highlight.

J'avais été assez moyennement satisfaite du premier tome, même si je l'avais trouvé fluide et j'aimais assez l'ambiance qui s'en dégageait. J'étais cependant curieuse de savoir comment les choses allaient évoluer. Il faut dire que le premier tome aurait pu être un one-shot. J'avais donc bien envie de savoir si cette suite allait gommer les éléments qui me dérangeaient et gagner en profondeur.

Malhreusuement, ça n'a pas été le cas et je dirais même que ça a été pire que ce que je redoutais. Autant vous prévenir, je m'arrêterais avec ce second tome pour cette série car même si cela se lit vite et j'apprécie le mélange romance/mythologie, ici, cela n'est pas assez équilibré.

Mon plus gros problème avec A touch of ruin a été Perséphone. Si j'avais été assez perplexe sur son personnage par moment dans le premier tome, elle s'en sortait pas si mal finalement. Dans ce second tome j'ai eu envie de la tarter tout du long. Elle se comporte comme une gamine capricieuse, égoïste et immature. C'est simple, elle ne faisait que crise sur crise. Une promesse ? Vite, allons faire tout l'inverse. Et pour peu qu'Hadès lui dise non ou lui demande de ne pas faire quelque chose, elle partait telle une furie pour le faire. J'appelle ça être buté et ce n'est pas un compliment. Au final, ce second tome se résumé à : disputes, boudage (digne de la maternelle), pour se rendre compte que finalement elle avait tord et réconciliation sur l'oreiller. Cela aurait pu passer si ce n'était pas ça TOUT DU LONG ! Et croyez-moi, j'ai arrêté de compter les disputes sur le même schéma parce que toutes les 10 pages c'était ça. Le pire, c'est qu'elle s'obstine pour un rien et qu'en prime, elle a toujours tord. En gros, elle fait de la résistance pour faire de la résistance. Cela en devient ridicule.

Heureusement pour elle, Hadès sera une crème et va s'excuser, réparer les pots casser et venir la sauver à chaque fois. Et c'est le second problème pour moi de ce tome. Comme je vous le disais dans le premier, je trouvais Hadès trop gentil. Eh bien ici, il se fait clairement marcher sur les pieds par Perséphone [...]

17956365263151456;"The lyrics follow a cause effect reaction cycle of sort and they jump back and forth from each other to effectively convey the story, or rather feelings of the narrator. The ‘story’ at hand is a telling of someone whose relationship is already decided, and, in an act of solemn acceptance, asks them to “be a bit morose and trouble [me], ok?” The character used, Mew, has a mature and firm voice. Throughout the song her voice is flat and vacant, reminiscent of the knowledge of “how this story is going to end.” However, her voice wavers and wanes through cracks in her solemnity and it is just so genuine that it hurts ☺️ the mv is so simple in the most picturesquely precise way possible. The words are piled at the bottom of the screen, where every lyric slowly rises up to its respective line reading the lyrics sprawled across the screen. EZFG is a producer I hold with high regards and utmost respect because of his fully independent music style; it is completely and utterly him and himself only. It is simple with a creative twist that makes it identifiable and varied from other vocaloid artists.

Now this was a hyped book of 2022 and I never got round to buying it but when twogirlsonebookpod said they were doing a buddy read of this I decided I wanted to read it!

Here's an unpopular opinion! This book did not reach the hype for me. As someone who isn't into gaming as an adult I found it hard to read and I couldn't follow the storyline very well. I felt the chapters ended on cliffhangers that never got picked up and the next chapter would jump so far. And chapter 9... Confused me. However, I loved the characters and following their emotions and lives, they were relatable but frustrating and it showed how people can struggle with building relationships with others whilst moving from adolescence into adulthood.

« Cher Père Noël, sors-moi de là ! »
d'Ena Fitzbel
chez J'ai lu

« De profil, il était plutôt beau. Un vrai jeune premier. Je peux maintenant vous dire que, de dos, il a tout d'un jeune con. Si mes yeux pouvaient jeter des éclairs, il y a belle lurette que son élégant costume serait calciné. »

💫 Fleur est élève vétérinaire à Paris. Pour les fêtes de fin d'année, elle souhaite se rendre chez sa maman, à Aix-en-Provence. Oui mais voilà, il y a une grève et il lui est donc impossible de partir en transports en commun. Heureusement, un chauffeur providentiel va l'accepter à bord de son véhicule, pour le meilleur et pour le pire ! 💫

❌ J'ai commencé ce livre avec un a priori positif : le niveau de langue est intéressant et l'histoire est racontée à deux voix, ce que j'ai apprécié. De plus, l'intitulé de chaque chapitre nous indique qui parle, la clarté est donc au rendez-vous.
Mais mon enthousiasme a vite été douché ! 
J'ai trouvé qu'il y avait dans cette romance beaucoup d'atermoiements inutiles, avant que, d'un coup, tout n'aille trop vite, sans qu'une véritable alchimie ait le temps de se créer. Les personnages font d'ailleurs preuve de très peu de bienveillance les uns envers les autres, ce qui est dommage, surtout en période de fêtes !
Quant aux analogies entre le protagoniste masculin et les chiens, drôles au début, elles alourdissent ensuite sérieusement le texte, qui manque aussi parfois de logique : qui va courir juste après avoir pris sa douche ? ❌

Unpopular opinion atau opini tidak populer adalah opini yang kadang sangat berbeda dengan opini umum di masyarakat.

Opini yang jarang muncul ke publik, karena tentu punya sisi sensitif serta bisa menimbulkan ketersinggungan yang berlebih.

Opini tidak harus benar, yang terpenting harus punya dasar. Dan tentunya, boleh setuju, boleh tidak.

Btw, apa unpopuler opinionmu? tulis di komentar ya!

Maybe it was the anticipation of it all, but I felt really let down. I mean, the plot was okay. A group of friends meet at college and there is one girl in the group who has it all - nice clothes, money, looks. And she dies one night. 

Now it's ten years later, and Hannah and Will, now married and expecting their first child, learn that the convicted murderer has died in prison. They are finally relieved only to have a young journalist come to their door with new information, causing Hannah to revisit the past and find out what happened. 

There many part of this book I simply felt annoyed by the characters. There wasn't really anything new or unique about this story. It was something I've felt like I read before. I suspected the twist pretty much from the beginning. Overall, I felt pretty blah about it.

Rahel und Peter sind um die 50 und seit fast 30 Jahren verheiratet. Die beiden Kinder sind aus dem Haus, das Leben geht seinen gewohnten Gang - so gewohnt, dass sich die Liebe aus der Ehe verabschiedet hat. Den Sommerurlaub wollen die beiden wie gewohnt in einem Ferienhaus in den Bergen in Bayern verbringen, doch daraus wird nichts. Kurz davor erhält Rahel nämlich einen Anruf des Besitzers, dass das Haus abgebrannt sei (damit schleicht sich beim Lesen natürlich gleich die Vermutung ein, dass sich der Buchtitel nicht nur auf dieses Ereignis, sondern auch auf den Zustand der Ehe bezieht). Die beiden fahren also stattdessen in die Uckermark, wo sie den Hof einer Freundin während deren Abwesenheit hüten. Dabei stellen sie sich die Fragen, ob nicht vielleicht doch noch Liebe vorhanden ist, wann die eigentlich verschwunden ist und ob sie ihre Ehe retten können. 
So weit zum Inhalt. Die im Grunde ziemlich abgedroschene Geschichte hätte trotzdem einen tollen Roman ergeben können - das ist Daniela Krien hier aber leider nicht gelungen (Achtung, #unpopularopinion). Es gab keine einzige Figur, die mir ansatzweise sympathisch war und spätestens nach 100 Seiten war ich von allen genervt (vor allem von Rahel). Dann hat sich noch ein Klischee an das nächste gereiht und alles war irgendwie platt. Obwohl der Roman keine 300 Seiten hat, hat sich das Ganze ziemlich gezogen. In der Kürze waren die Figuren auch nicht richtig ausgearbeitet, die Tiefe hat gefehlt. Was mich zum Beispiel an den Figuren genervt hat: Zum einen die Klischees - Rahels Tochter Selma wird als junge, überforderte Mutter dargestellt, deren ""neuen"" Erziehungsmethoden Rahel nicht gutheißt. Heute seien ja alle so empfindlich und früher sei es auch gegangen. Überhaupt verhält sich Rahel ziemlich herablassend gegenüber anderen Menschen - sowohl ihrer Tochter als auch ihren Patient*innen gegenüber (sie ist Psychotherapeutin). Außerdem wurden Rahel und Peter irgendwie älter dargestellt, als sie sind. Beim Lesen hatte ich oft den Eindruck, dass sie um die 70, nicht um die 50 sind.

Weil es ja in letzter Zeit hier bei Bookstagram wieder mal heiß her ging (ich gebe zu, ich habe die Diskussion irgendwie nur am Rande mitbekommen…), nur eines, was ich dem Zitat von Virginia Woolf noch hinzufügen möchte:

Lest bitte einfach, worauf ihr Lust habt! 📚💛

Lasst euch nicht fertigmachen von all den Neuerscheinungen, die gefühlt schon wieder alle gelesen haben, nur ihr nicht 😱 Lest Bücher vom SuB, von der Backlist oder solche, die vielleicht mal außerhalb der eigenen Komfortzone liegen 😌 Alle singen Lobeshymnen auf dieses eine Buch und ihr denkt: „Haben die das gleiche Buch gelesen wie ich?“ 🤔 So what! Traut euch, auch mal eine #unpopularopinion zu posten. Ich persönlich bin dankbar für kritische und vor allem ehrliche Bücherstimmen 😊 
Und vor allem: Lasst euch bitte nicht von irgendjemandem verbieten, ein bestimmtes Buch oder Genre zu lesen! Das entscheidet nur ihr selbst ☺️

So, und jetzt zurück auf die Couch und den Sonntag genießen! 🤓🙋‍♀️ Alternativ könnt ihr mir von euren Erfahrungen mit diesem Thema berichten ☺️💛

I think that Len is tuned very elegant, majestic and like a wise teenager in ""Here comes Karakasa-san"". He has a beautiful like angelic femboy aura and he just fits the song pretty much. It feels like he is speaking face to face to me. Len is sometimes tuned a little bit too high-pitched or harsh but his voice sounds clear, soft and just unique to me.

-SPOILERS AHEAD-

 Okay so, this might be a bit of an unpopular opinion but this book fell a bit short for me. I had heard such good things about it but ultimately I just didn't understand the reason for the cheating? Elle had so many opportunities to be with Jonas before getting married to Peter but she chose not to be and then decided to introduce them into each other lives just to cheat on her husband with her first love..when imo there wasn't a reason for them to stay apart in the first place? I don't really recall there being any chemistry between Elle and Peter and there didn't seem to be any reason for them to be together other than the fact that he was a good man/good father. I actually felt quite sorry for him tbh. There were some aspects of the book that were well written such as the family drama and sensitive issues mentioned in flashback chapters (please check trigger warnings) I did also really enjoy the relationship between the Elle and Anna but I think that's about it? The story covered such sensitive topics and felt like quite a heavy book and the ending just did not do it for me.";2023-02-06 06:02:39+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:31.918985+00:00;8;65;en

❓What is a recent read that you’ve last been disappointed by?

Contemporary Romance
Pub day: October 2018
First person present tense, dual POV

I’ve read and absolutely loved her book One Night on the Island. It’s actually one of my favorite reads of the year, but this one is one of my most disappointing reads of the year. 

I read this book with noshelf.control fireplace.bookwotm doxigirl83 and reading_is_better_than_sleep and we had some great discussions around it! Loved reading with y'all! ☺️

👎
-  This book takes place over 8 years. We get a couple scenes from each year. This erases most emotional depth from the book. Whenever something big happens to the main character, it is resolved in at most a chapter or two. There are no stakes. Someone dies? No worries, she is only devastated for 2 chapters. She loses an important relationship? They'll have made up off the page, back to their usual shenanigans in no time. 
- The main love is flawed from the get go. The two MCs see each other at a bus stop, their eyes meet, there’s a connection. That’s it. And after a year of searching for this dude, who could just as well be a douchebag, he turns up as her best friend’s couple months old boyfriend. Given the tenuous connection at the beginning, you would think she’d just move on. But no, they both lust after each other for over a year until she finally decides to put some distance. 
- What’s worse is the guy isn’t that great, he’s emotionally cheating on the best friend the whole time, acting like a jealous asshole when the main girl finally decides to move on, and when something pretty big happens to him, he completely loses it on everyone, not because of what happened, but because he lost a job opportunity. He’s basically a selfish man-child throughout. 

Mainly though, I just couldn’t get over the fact that someone would betray their best friend in such a way, and for so long. Even after years pass, and to give the book due credit, there’s some work done to make their relationship somewhat palatable, I could never root for these two after that beginning.

Doar ea știe prin ce stări am trecut citindu-l. 🤣 Nu am așteptat deloc momentul acesta, momentul în care să vă vorbesc despre carte. 🫠 De fapt, am făcut tot posibilul să-l evit, însă iată că tot a sosit. 😀 

  Lumea creată de către autoare este extrem de complexă, toată detaliile și liniile de descendență și mai știu eu ce au fost on-point. 🤌🏻🤌🏻 Mi-a plăcut toată partea aceasta, însă în rest m-a plictisit GRAV. Înțeleg că ideea a fost ca acțiunea să decurgă lent în așa fel încât să putem observa evoluția dintre personajele principale, dar de la un timp pur și simplu mă săturasem. Cartea se rezumă la - spice 🌶 - Poppy care are întrebări la fiecare câteva pagini și de aici pornesc discuții lungi - some more spice 🌶 - puțină acțiune - Poppy care vrea să înjunghie pe cineva, iar apoi totul se repetă din nou, la nesfârșit. 🙄

  A trecut cam o lună de când am citit cartea și mă jur că nu mai știu de ce i-am acordat 3🌟, adică acum aș scădea foarte mult din punctaj :))))) pur și simplu nu-mi pot aduce aminte aspectele pozitive ale cărții. 

  Evident, este doar părerea mea, experiența voastră poate să fie una diferită. ☺️ Sunt una dintre puținele persoane cărora nu le-a plăcut cartea, poate nu am citit-o eu la momentul potrivit. 🤷🏻‍♀️

You can try to time the market, but should you? No.
The best time to buy a house is when you're ready.
Take a look, or rather, have me take a look, at your finances to make sure you're pre-approved and when you find the house you love, buy it!
When rates are in your favour, house prices might not be, and vise versa.
But when your finances are in line and the right house comes along, that's when it's the perfect time to buy. Prove me wrong 😜

There are things you can do to try to reduce your cost of borrowing which are much easier than trying to buy the house that got away because you wanted to wait until rates went back down. Let's chat! #yourmortgagestartshere

Sorry not sorry! 

So TJR can write a hellofa tale, I'll give her that.  However,  I just struggled to see the point of this one.  Evelyn has some skeletons in the closet and wants to be rid of all of them before she dies, I get that.  But the 7 marriages were just too much.  Each relationship didn't hold my attention  and this story just wasn't for me.  The twist at the end was reeeally far fetched and made me scoff. 

I did like the golden days of Hollywood aspect and her friend Harry.  Other than that.......🤷🏼‍♀️

▪️Dr. J: “Hay ciertas cosas que Pippen hizo por ese equipo que Michael no hizo.  Definitivamente en la defensa. Creo que, ofensivamente, él siempre es consciente de involucrar a los demás. No quiero quitarle nada a Michael, pero creo que Scottie es el paquete total, y eso hace que se complementen realmente bien "".

Similarmente, el ex compañero de equipo de Pippen, John Paxson, dijo que la presencia de Pippen en la cancha era de extrema importancia.

17846744432775403;"🍼BOOK REVIEW👶
Just Like Mother by Anne Heltzel
⭐⭐💫/5

Bief summary: Maeve and her cousin Andrea were part of a motherhood cult when they were children. After a raid on the cult, they went separate ways: Maeve is now a struggling editor in NYC, Andrea is a wealthy fertility mogul in the Catskills. Two decades later they reconnect, and secrets are dug up from the past.

▶️EDIT: I'd like to clarify that I am not saying I think this is a bad book. I'm just sharing my personal opinions as a reader. I'm genuinely sorry if you love this book and it offends you, that's not my intent at all.

I have a lot of problems with this book. The plot is predictable. The protagonist is naïve and quite dumb. There are some moments that I got second-hand  embarrassment from, like the really awkward and out-of-place sex scenes.

What most affected my enjoyment, though, was that 75% of this book felt like a domestic thriller. The horror is a social horror - it depends on the reader having an emotional trigger in response to ideas of motherhood. Other than that we have a few flashbacks that are slightly disturbing and an ending that is alright (but predictable). The creepy cult, though? We barely scratch the surface. 

Now, I love a book with a slow burn, and I'm fine if most of the action happens in the final third or quarter. Rosemary's Baby and The Elementals are two of my favorites where less actually happened throughout the bulk of the book than in Just Like Mother. The difference is that the atmosphere is heavy and dripping with dread in those, and they have tension and likeable characters. Unfortunately, Just Like Mother does not give me any of those things.

I personally don't recommend this book. I think it was cellulose_and_lignin (correct me if I'm wrong) who said he would have preferred a prequel, and I wholeheartedly agree.
🚨 *However,* I think you may enjoy it if you like domestic thrillers or are particularly affected by things like being pressured to have kids. I can't speak to that experience, but I do know someone who really enjoyed this read because she had an emotional response to that type of horror.";2022-06-04 18:39:23+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:31.934669+00:00;35;304;en

Agree or Disagree? Write down in the comments

Admin thoughts: I'm mixed about this. Growls are like breaths: They can add something to a song but once only slightly overused it ruins everything. If you want an example where growls are used correctly you can check out Attract Light (on the album is a Len version I'm talking specifically about that one)

“The Spanish Love Deception”

🚨 This is gonna be an unpopular kinda book review. 😬 

⬇️ Important Facts ⬇️

1. I am OBSESSED with the fake-dating troupe
2. I am a Latina who loves romance books. 
3. This whole story sounded perfect for me!
4. Everyone seems to LOOOVE this book.

➡️ This book did NOT do it for me, and I am DISAPPOINTED, you guys!!!

I really, truly did not want this story to be as boring and bland as it felt for me.  Am I missing something??!!

At times, Aaron seemed like the dream book boyfriend.  But as they got closer, it gave me more ick vibes than swoony ones.  There was cringe and narcissism where the spice was supposed to be. 

“Baby….it’s me you need.  It’s all for me”. Ugggggghhhhhh I just couldn’t get into it. 

I know this is a VERY loved book, and this is an incredibly unpopular opinion.  I’d love to hear YOUR thoughts!

18224292601190753;"📖 BOOK REVIEW 📖 

“But most of us are too scared to even ask what we want, in case we can’t have it.” 

You And Me On Vacation - Emily Henry

QOTD: have you finished all of your Easter treats? 

AOTD: I still have this freckle egg left! I left it to last because it’s one of my favourites and I want to save it for when I have time to enjoy it 😍

2.5 ⭐️ 

I enjoyed this.. until I didn’t

This story is basically a miscommunication trope blown up to epic proportions.

Followed by another exact same miscommunication ….

Basically I enjoyed it until we found out what happened in the past.. and then I didn’t like it… and then I resumed enjoying it when we emerged from the present day repeat scenario …

There were a lot of things I liked in this one too; there are interesting characters, the writing is easy to read and follow, I liked how it alternated between the past and current summers… 

I just hated the miscommunication x 2 (of the same issue) and it ruined the whole thing for me, left me feeling annoyed as I closed the book. 

So idk 🤷🏼‍♀️ have you read this one? What did you think?

I hate posting reviews when I didn’t like the book after seeing so many people enjoy it, it makes me second guess myself and wonder if maybe I missed something or if I wasn’t in the mood for the book… but I’ve stewed on this review for a while and it is what it is! This one just wasn’t for me!

17889079235754564;"Unpopular Opinion Incoming

I know some fellow readers will hate me for this but, as always, I'll be honest: this year I've been let down by almost all the romcoms I've read this year, one way or another, but one of them takes the cake, because I ended up dropping it, and I rarely DNF books. And yes it's one of the books in the picture.

Here's the list of romcom books that most disappointed me this year:

- Weather Girl, Rachel Lynn Solomon
- The Road Trip, Beth O’Leary
- The STEMinist Novellas, Ali Hazelwood
- Love on the Brain, Ali Hazelwood
- You Deserve Each Other, Sarah Hogle
- The Ex Talk, Rachel Lynn Solomon
- Lease on Love, Falon Ballard
- Twice Shy, Sarah Hogle
- Kiss Her Once For Me, Alison Cochrun
- It Happened One Summer (DNF), Tessa Bailey

Some just felt like a lot of wasted potential, others just were the same thing over and over, some authors I think are just not for me.

As for It Happened One Summer, I know many people loved it and I think the movie adaptation might work, but I felt no chemistry, the sex scene was not to my taste, the whole thing between the leads felt rushed and there was all this talk about ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" that just felt weird and rubbed me the wrong way.
This is, of course, just my opinion, if you loved this book, that's great!

Do you read romcom books? Would you like me write a review about one of these specific titles? What's your favourite book from this genre?
...
Quest'anno, purtroppo, le commedie romantiche mi hanno quasi tutte delusa. Una amata da molt*, poi, è addirittura andata a finire nella lista dei libri non finiti, cosa che non faccio spesso.

Voi leggete commedie romantiche? Qual è il vostro romanzo preferito appartenente al genere?

Teacher-led lessons are not bad, but student-led ones are so much better!⁠

⁠
...and then using those same student ideas to drive instruction that results in meaningful lessons.⁠
⁠
💫 It's a win-win.⁠
⁠
🕒 I know one of the biggest arguments I get is there isn't enough time. But with student-led lessons that explore multiple methods in problem solving, you don't even need to worry about completing a whole page of questions!⁠

After I finished the concert I went to bed unsure how to feel. I mean, THAT was the amazing Kagamine concert we were all so excited for..? It was 90% reused assets. Aside from the intro where they thank us for being there and the new song by WanOppo at the end, it was all just stuff from older concerts. They couldn't even bother to update the modules so during the concert they were constantly flipping between different looks and it was extremely jarring. Not to mention for the Good Is Yeah performance they were just in their default outfits... Miku gets new ones a couple times a year and Crypton can't even bother giving them ONE new outfit..?

Is this something you've noticed as well? I think there is a way to hook people without constantly chastising them for things they don't know yet.

Most people I know can’t start their day without coffee - including my husband. Many have a whole ritual around coffee — a specific machine, grinding the beans, a collection of coffee cups - I’m sure y’all know what I’m talking about. The memes re drinking coffee are abundant, too. 

Me? I saw my Mom and Dad not be able to start their day without coffee and decided at an early age that was never going to be me! I’m not a fan of the aroma, taste - none of it! Don’t even get me started on the money sink called Starbucks! 😂 Of course, I married a coffee connoisseur who is a GRUMP if he doesn’t get his coffee but, thankfully, prefers to make his own and has the counterspace in the kitchen to prove it. 😘 

So…what’s your opinion? Coffee lover or not?

As a society we have normalized caffeine as a daily habit/ ritual. We seem to generally ignore the fact that excessive amounts of it, especially on a daily basis, can have a very negative impact on our mental and physical health. 

I was introduced to coffee when I was 8 years old. It was heavily diluted with milk, but as I got older it got darker and much more frequent. Packed with sugar or just plain black coffee, I drank it everyday before school throughout high school and college and many years following. It wasn't until I was 23 that I thought...maybe I should take a break and see what happens.

I WISH someone would have told me to stop or offered me an alternative sooner. I struggled with severe anxiety and depression as well as accumulating a bunch of digestive problems. I am certainly not blaming this all on my caffeine habit, but I know it was a contributor. Once I stopped the daily use, my anxiety wasn't as bad, my sleep dramatically improved and I was able to effectively heal my digestion. It's amazing what one small change can do. Even if it feels like a big ask 

I still enjoy coffee from time to time and get a very small dose of caffeine with the cacao I drink daily. I use it when I need it and am quickly reminded as to why I don't consume so much daily anymore. 

I am not here to tell you to stop drinking coffee or tea, just offering some perspective and maybe a small lifestyle change that could make a big difference.

Another You've Got Mail-adjacent romcom, this time set between rival Chinese Zodiac matchmakers.

The Good
Parts of this book are hella cute: the Match-Off idea, the dates, the food and family gatherings around said food. The prose is also very light and digestible.

The Not-So-Good
This couple didn't work for me. Olivia is floppier than a flip-flop. Her super late-stage freak-out is terrible, and it dismantled a lot of what the beginning and middle sections were building. Bennett is very sweet but he's too perfect, too idealized, and although their banter is cute, he offers no real push-back on Olivia's lumpy character arc. He ends up doing all the work to get them to a HEA that Olivia doesn't need; she needs a vacation.

The only other thing I care to mention—and this was a big red flag—is that there are three (technically four) forms of supplementary content from or about the author in which they talk more about the multicultural/generational identity aspect of the book. I'm sure that's probably helpful to someone, but if a book has done its job well, then it shouldn't require so much additional clarity on its thematic intent. 🤷

A little over-hyped, this one.

My conclusive note in the margin would be: ""Naked Truth? Let's not romanticise abuse.""

And yes, I read her note at the end, and I understand what she was trying to do, but that made it worse for me. For someone who's seen this type of abuse firsthand to write a character like Vyle - sorry, Ryle - and hit readers with the 'there are no bad people' line while watching Lily excuse his behavior again and again is just, IMHO, outright damaging. 

Romanticising abuse and trauma for a whole new generation of readers when you KNOW the damage this shit does is straight-up unforgivable. And from the author's note, Hoover should know better. 

There. I said what I said. And you know what? Normally I'd tag on a ' just my opinion etc.', but when it comes to books that glamourise abuse in a sheen of hot neurosurgeon with steamy sex and and deep, dark, backstory to emotionally manipulate predominantly young female readers - Just. Nope.

Unpopular opinion ahead....

I really struggled with the rating of this book. I did not like it, but I appreciated the author's work on it and incorporation of science into the novel.

The world is against Chemist Elizabeth Zott in this very not humorous novel. I loved the first half of it, but the middle dragged so much and the ending was too perfect in my opinion. I can understand why so many people loved it, but it just didn't work for me.

Things I liked:
-- The dog named Six-Thirty was seriously the best character, although I was not expecting this book to have an odd anthropomorphic twist to it.
-- A strong female protagonist and scientist. I hated how the author made many of the other women characters weak, though.
-- Miss Frask.

Things I didn't like:
-- Every single person's life in the late 50s/early 60s seemed to be miserable. Joy was not really present in this novel.
-- The men in this story. I think the author went over the top to make the men piggish and sexist. And while this can be the case often in a male dominated work place, it is not always the case.
-- Conflicts started to feel forced to progress the storyline.
-- Zott was an interesting character, but I was constantly getting annoyed with her (she reminded me a little of the protagonist in Nita Prose's The Maid in that she was frustratingly and unrealistically naive when it came to social norms).
-- All the triggers that I wouldn't expect in a book described as ""laugh-out-loud funny"" such as abuse, death, suicide, and rape (twice).
-- The author's belief that science and religion don't have any common ground. She really beat the dead horse on this subject, and it became an eyeroll for me every time a character brought up the topic.
-- This book seemed unnecessarily long. It was 400 pages, or 12 hours (because I listened to the audiobook). I kept losing interest in it and at times dreaded listening about the depressing, horrible life of a woman in the late 50s/early 60s.

Peculiar, Depressing, but Likeable at times, I didn't love the book, but can understand why others might.

Molly the maid is all alone in the world. A nobody. She’s used to being invisible in her job at the Regency Grand Hotel, plumping pillows and wiping away the grime, dust and secrets of the guests passing through. She’s just a maid – why should anyone take notice?
 
But Molly is thrown into the spotlight when she discovers an infamous guest, Mr Black, very dead in his bed. This isn’t a mess that can be easily cleaned up. And as Molly becomes embroiled in the hunt for the truth, following the clues whispering in the hallways of the Regency Grand, she discovers a power she never knew was there. She’s just a maid – but what can she see that others overlook?

Unpopular opinion ahead...

I failed to see what was so great about this book. The story was predictable, the main character a very much stereotypical maid with OCD and on the spectrum. I love seeing people on the spectrum represented in books, but their representation must be done right, and throwing the same clichés over and over it is not the way to do it. There's much more to such characters than that! 

There was some humour I failed to understand. Like why is ""Molly the maid"" funny? Did I miss a back story or it's just the alliteration? I mean, people in the book were so amused by it, and I was 😐

Apart from that, very little happened in the 340 page of the book, if you leave out the cleaning, talking about cleaning, reminiscing about cleaning with gran, and reprimanding people eating with their elbows on the table (don't get me wrong, I agree you don't do it, but mentioning it every time there was eating involved it was a bit much). 

Sadly, not the book for me (nice edges though). 

Thank you therubyreads for the buddy read 🙂

OK sooooooo...pawfectpages.x recommended this to me for sooooo long and I finally got round to reading it with the beautiful amyreads1000 but was I blown away??? Unfortunately no...

I don't know whether it's a typical case of a book being too hyped up so then you expect too much? Possibly. But I just found myself waiting for something more.

That's not to say that the plot was lacking in drama...it had lots of...(many triggers too so make sure to check that out) but I just couldn't find any of the characters relatable and I always find that brings a huge block for me. Like with Crawdads, it was beautifully written, just wasn't hugely for me!

Do you find hyped up books let you down?

Après ça, vous pourrez parfaitement dire que je suis pessimiste, je ne pourrais pas vous le reprocher 😂.

🌊 Bien sûr, cet avis n'engage que moi et je peux comprendre qu'il ait plu à beaucoup de personnes, la magie n'a juste pas opéré sur moi...

I have conflicting feelings about this book! I've not enjoyed it as much as I hoped and I know that is completely okay but I wonder if I sabotaged myself by watching the film first (not something I usually do).

I quite enjoyed the film and I do think it was a very close adaption although I didn't see the chemistry between Lucy and Josh in either medium in all honesty! There are quite a few bits that I'd like to pick apart too - I know they're supposed to hate each other but some events just irked me - every time Josh calls Lucy pathetic my jaw clenched and teeth ground together 🤣.

This one has gone on my unhaul pile I'm afraid!

17887610615714828;"Katherine Mays Buch hatte ich mir bewusst für die dunkle, graue Jahreszeit aufbewahrt, vielleicht, um auch emotional in der richtigen Stimmung dafür zu sein. 
Sie schreibt über Lebensphasen, in denen man, sie, sich fühlt wie „aus der Welt gefallen.“ Sei es durch gravierende Einschnitte, Verluste oder Veränderungen im Leben, sei es durch schwere Erkrankungen. Sie selbst nennt diese Phasen ein „Überwintern“ und erläutert in ihrem Buch ihren ganz persönlichen Umgang damit. Sowohl der totale Zusammenbruch wie auch glückliche Momente und Augenblicke der Selbstfürsorge schildert sie in sehr persönlicher und direkter Art. 

Mit einer abschließenden Meinung zu diesem Buch tue ich mich unerwartet schwer. Einige Absätze habe ich verschlungen, musste und wollte bewusst anschließend innehalten und reflektieren. Gerade die Passagen zum Lesen und zu den stillen Nachtstunden gefielen mir sehr gut und haben mich sehr berührt. Dann aber sind da viele andere Momente, die ich eher irritierend und befremdlich fand, wie z.B. ihre Art, den Urlaub in Tromsø zu beschreiben oder ihre Beweggründe zum Neujahrsschwimmen. 

Üblicherweise kann ich auch Wochen nach dem Lesen eines Buches die Geschichte Revue passieren lassen und hier wiedergeben. Bei diesem Buch aber war es leider so, dass ich ohne meine Markierungen und Kommentare kaum etwas hätte schreiben können. Nicht, weil es nicht gefiel, sondern schlicht, weil es nichts „hinterlassen“ hat außer diesen mit Bleistift gezeichneten Strichen, Linien und Herzen. Vielleicht waren aber auch meine Erwartungshaltungen schlicht zu hoch, da ich hier sehr viele begeisterte, berührende und mitreißende Rezensionen zu „Überwintern“ gelesen hatte, die mich überhaupt erst zu diesem Kauf inspiriert hatten. Schade, dass ich diese Meinungen nicht zu 100% teilen kann.

Wer hat’s gelesen? Wie erging es Euch damit? Hatten ihr vielleicht auch hier und da kritische Momente?

17969535835909143;"“And so the white cat knelt all night, never turning around. And so the dumb dog stood all night, never once leaving.”

⭐️⭐️💫

I can only beg forgiveness. 😭

Take two things that you don’t really care one way or the other about, push ‘em together and say “now kiss.” … and that will roughly be my feeling while reading this book.

Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy Chu Wanning and Mo Ran on their own, I like their character types in general—but I failed to feel any chemistry between them together. I have no clue why these two are attracted to each other. I don’t know why Chu Wanning has a crush on his 15 year old student other than that he thought he was ~pretty. I don’t know why Mo Ran is so attached to his Shizun other than that… he thought he was pretty. (Also apparently assumed he’d be gentle, but Idk why.) Even when he routinely insists that he hates Shizun, I don’t know why. Because he’s cold and abusive? Valid, but also he’s cold and abusive to everyone, must we really become evil emperors of the mortal world about it? At one point, he screams in such emotional anguish, “I adored you!” And all I can do is scream back “BUT WHY THOUGH???”

There’s a steady supply of suggestive situations that I feel was meant to carry all the chemistry for these two, and it didn’t work for me. I love a One Coffin trope as much as the next danmei fan, but turns out I need to care about the couple first, otherwise it’s just two dudes in a coffin and one of them’s making it awkward with his boner. 🙄 I hate when that happens.

I do love the idea of this story, and there were moments that I did enjoy in this. (Swipe to see an illustration from one of my favorite scenes.) I do genuinely like Chu Wanning, I can empathize with his social awkwardness… though maybe a reputation for breaking the legs of your students is a tad excessive. I love the fanart for this story, I love the passion of its fans. I’m also curious about a lot of things! There’s a murderous nutjob with a tangerine tree that I’d love to see again. And I am sus of Shi Mei.

I’m still debating if I’ll continue though because this story is MASSIVE and that’s a lot of commitment for just maybe. 🤔";2023-01-05 21:37:39+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:37.738905+00:00;43;117;en

🥯 
I was going to wait to post this till after Valentine’s Day but I decided it’s actually perfect for today. The author says in her notes at the end that this is a book about love and I agree. She reminded me that love between friends is just as valuable as romantic love, if not more so. I am so grateful for quality, long-lasting friendships! I’ve gotta say though… I hated this book. I never intended to read it because video games are not my thing but my book club picked it and wow it’s even more gaming-filled than I ever could have imagined. And as veryhungryreader helped me understand in her review, I also didn’t like the book because the characters were so aggravating. She said she wanted to shake them and that’s exactly how I felt. So glad I’m finally done!

⭐️⭐️💫

“Somethings are worth waiting for, no matter how long it takes”. (And believe me, I felt like it took them forever) 

I think I’m in the minority here but I have a bit of an unpopular opinion. 

I was frustrated +++ for the first 30% of this book and even considered DNFing it out of pure frustration. This is a book where everything and I mean everything could be solved if they just openly communicated. The book for me was saved once the fake dating started, but even then, I was like oh come on guys. 

The characters where cute, and it’s a friends to lovers, fake dating slow burn sports romance. If you love those tropes than you might love this. It’s also a very wholesome, and pretty clean romance. 

We follow Bree who is in love with her best friend Nathan, but so is everyone. Nathan is a famous attractive quarterback. Bree owns a dance studio but is struggling to financially afford this for much longer. Nathan wants to help but Bree doesn’t want to rely on him. 

Bree and Nathan have been besties since school and have both been dating other people for years. This is the first time in six years that they’re both single. 

Bree gets drunk and blabs to a reporter where she talks about her true feelings for Nathan. This results is a media storm and Bree and Nathan start to fake date in order to save Bree’s dance studio thanks to the endorsement deals attached. 

Overall, I’m happy I read this and did enjoy the characters themselves. Whilst this wasn’t a winner for me, it might be a favourite for you. 

Thankyou to alittlebitbooked for recommending this as part of my 12 recs by 12 friends. Sorry I didn’t adore it. I think I’ve read too many Tessa Baileys recently and so this fell short for me. Lol.

Additional Information:For Hatsune Miku NT, iXima significantly changed Miku's design. Miku once again has ""more hair"", a change from V4X in which her pigtails were slimmer. Her ribbons are no longer square shaped, and are instead round. The red stripes have been moved back into the ribbons, and the ribbons themselves are no longer part of her headphones. Her headphones have been completely redesigned, becoming primarily grey/silver, have a red stripe near the black padded ear cover, and sport a teal headband with black trim. Her top now has wavy frills. She sports two silver AT keyboard ports on her collar, like the ones on MEIKO's skirt on her V3 design. Her top no longer has the VOCALOID logo and instead has notes input into an interface replacing it. Mikus' tie has been redesigned completely, now being more ribbon-like. Her skirt and sleeves appear to no longer feature the design of the DX-100 and DX-7. The end of her skirt is now wavy and no longer features AT keyboard ports. She now sports a grey chain connected to her skirt, similar to the one on her V2 and V3 designs. Her shoes have been redesigned to a more traditional style of heels, and feature frills. On the tops of the frills are two small white circles that overlap each other, while the bottom of the frills feature an upside-down teal WiFi symbol.

17914193363666189;"Thoughts on goal setting ✍️🤓
Are you someone who sets goals for the year? Have you fallen into the pattern of procrastinating until the very end of the year? From what I hear online every year as people look back on their goals, it’s very common. Life happens, priorities change. And that’s absolutely normal.

That’s why I don’t believe in goal setting for the year 😅 #unpopularopinion 

I think that a year is a very unsuitable time span to plan something for our personal development (for businesses that’s different). You can’t really achieve something major in a year. Can’t learn a language, can’t get really good at some complex skill, etc. You can try something out, start, continue or finish doing something complex. And then of course you can accomplish less complex things but then you usually don’t need a year for them. For me those fall under the category of to-do’s or plans that one can put on a more short-term list.

What I believe in is long/mid-term and incremental (small) goals. Say, my mid-term goal is to earn as much or more as I used to on my “normal” job. Obviously I can’t achieve this in a year. But I can break it down to smaller steps and put the ones I need to start doing right now on my to-do list for the next 3 months. Then break those down into what I need to do this month, this week. 

I believe that shorter planning timespans guided by a general mid-term vision is the most productive way of advancing in the right direction. 

Things will shift and change, life will happen, unexpected opportunities will arise. But 3 months is more foreseeable than a year, and also they don’t let you procrastinate and think you still have soooo much time until the end of the year. Shorter timespans motivate you to get going.

My whole life experience teaches me that results will come if you apply yourself with incremental steps. Sometimes the results don’t look exactly as you envisioned them. But they will hit within the ballpark and that’s what matters. Better than procrastinating until November and yet again recognise that you didn’t get to do much of what you planned.

What do you think? Any arguments for yearly goal-setting?";2023-01-03 11:08:37+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:37.738905+00:00;5;0;en

17876994311785913;"The ""S"" Word.

""Smile!""

Children are inquisitive, compassionate, ruthless, unfiltered little humans. 

Some love to smile, some have a natural coy smirk, and all of them look at the world around them with curiosity. 

Many parents want THE smiling shot.

Heck, I want THE smiling shot -as a parent and as a photographer.
I have even gone so far as to photoshop a tiny little smile from another photo of the child onto the ""best"" group selection.
Yes, I've done this multiple times. 

My favourites are the candids, though. 

I took a series of photographs of my little girl, and inadvertantly stumbled onto a smile -she was being equal parts mischievous/silly which plays perfectly to her typical self. 

I think that the more space we give the little ones to explore their surroundings, the more likely they'll be to present a smile in response to their findings, rather than coaxing, as gentle as it might be. While I wasn't looking for the smile, I'm glad I got it -but I personally love the documentation of her mannerisms just as much.

Would love to hear your take on the topic or let me know which is your favourite: 1, 2, or 3.

I noticed many beginner vocalop with so many paid voicebanks (more than 5) but with little to 0 knowledge on basic music theory. I know a few of them started as cover artist, but if they wanna get serious with music writing/producing, they should invest in music writing/producing lessons and music gear instead of voicebanks because in the end, voicebanks should be the last priority. Utau and synth v basic are free. In the long run, it’s better to buy and learn an instrument, basic audio mixing, etc. Please do not take this as an attack because I just want people to improve and this is mostly a criticism towards myself.

Funny You Should Ask by Elissa Sussman
I've seen a lot of hype around this book.  Here's my thoughts... (unpopular opinion)
🛑🛑🛑Slight Spoiler ahead🛑🛑🛑
💗What I liked:
- The beginning was good
- I liked the characters
- The ending was good and finally made me actually interested in the plot... right when it ended
😬What I didn't love:
-1 drunk weekend and they form a love that lasts without talking or seeing each other for 10 years? 
-the middle was rushed and at the same time really boring
- why was she ever with the Novelist? That whole relationship was undeveloped and I could not understand why they were together...other than saying she loved him there was no story or dialog to back that up. 
- what is with the Jelly Beans? 
▪︎Overall this is entertaining but had me wishing I had a couple hours of my day back. 
QOTD: What was the last book you read that wasn't worth the hype?

The fact that there is a main group just makes vocaloid more enjoyable for me. I also think that there is everything a good group needs in the main group and I feel like the other vocaloids are overrated as they don’t have an expo or group or anything that makes them stand out and gives them more character. I still do love some vocaloids that aren’t cryptonoids like v flower, gumi and lily, but there is something in crypton that I really like compared to the others. (IMOOOO)

“Groundskeeping” - Lee Cole 

🍃SYNOPSIS: Swipe —>

🍃REVIEW: Do you ever read a book and you finish and say “what was the point of this novel??”.. Yeah, that was me with Groundskeeping.

Don’t get me wrong. I’m a literary/contemporary fiction ho. I love a story simply for the sake of being a good story. But this was just not it. It was an absolute snooze fest, and as I finish, I’m just like.. what was the meaning in it all? Why was it written?

First, let me say that I had to switch to audio. Unlike Normal People, where I was able to keep up, this book does not use quotation marks for dialogue, so it was sooo hard to figure out who was talking and when. Because of this, I felt the audiobook would serve me better, and I did felt it helped me out in that aspect. But I gotta ask, why do authors do this?! It can be done well, but in this case, it wasn’t - and only added to the confusion and my dislike of the story.

I don’t have too much more to say other than I didn’t enjoy this and wish I had spent my time on another book.

THE POSITIVE: I do think the writing was done well; just add a more interesting plot and this author would do better in the future!

🍃VERDICT: 2 STARS ⭐️⭐️

🎶 SONG REC: “Burning Down the House” - Talking Heads (we did get a full essay on Talking Heads in this book which I appreciated)

18054226744330834;"☀️ Book Review ☀️

Well well well…another book that tugged at my heartstrings. But it’s with a heavy heart that I must inform you, I did not love this book.

This was a cute read and I was liking it…until the end. She really had me in the first 80% but that last 20% is where she lost me. I felt so upset by that plot twist and idk if I can get past it. It made me so mad and it just felt so out of character for everyone involved. Both the reveal and the reconciliation span over like the last 15ish pages and it felt so rushed. It almost felt like the author got 80-90% done with the book and was like “oh shit I forgot to throw in a conflict”. All that build up for basically nothing.

I was so invested in Percy and Sam’s love story and adored them as children! Their progression from friends to lovers in their youth was so natural and their connection was genuine. I loved that they were able to be so authentically themselves with each other. The alternating timeline in this book was very well executed, but this book takes place majority in the past. I felt a little bit of a disconnect to present day Sam and Percy because I didn’t really know them as adults.

Overall though, I can see why this book is so loved by #booksta. For me though, there are just some things that rub me the wrong way and unfortunately this book had them.

18148699108211563;"Before i get into this, I want to clarify that I am not calling the crypton vocaloids overrated. What makes them popular isn’t their voicebanks; in reality, its their characters, and crypton does a good job at selling Miku as a character. But that being said, crypton, before V5 and SynthV was already falling behind. Meiko and Kaitos V3s were notoriously outdated, Lukas V4 was outdone by pretty much every other voicebank of her vocal tone in quality such as Yukari and Akari, and Miku and The Kagamines were not ground breaking voicebanks by any means either. And than V5 and SynthV comes out and they moved out of both options. NT is a flop, straight up. For a new program its like 3 steps backwards. Untop of all of this, cryptonloids still remain the most expensive and NT isnt cheap either, but compared to others. Its quality is not up to snuff. Even compared to other vocaloid 4 voicebanks, but than you pull in SynthV and the AI voicebanks and than you hear the vsinger v5 updates and its disappointing. This isnt meant to be hate, its not directed with hate but its directed with disappointment because I want the crypton vocaloids to be at the modern standard, but they havent been for a long time and im starting to worry the gaps only going to get larger

TW: abuse (really disappointed that no one talks about this when it’s a pretty important part of the story) 

Since everyoneeeee on booksta knows what this book is about, this review is gonna be short and sweet

If you didn’t know, I tried to read the physical book six (yes SIX) different times. I even let a friend borrow it and my bookmark was still holding my place around page 80. I’m a HUGE fan of DNFing if I’m not feeling the book. But y’all are OBSESSED with this one, so I had to listen to it to finish 

Please, inform me why you love it. Is it because you love Adam Driver? Cause sure, I could understand that. Is it because there’s a woman in STEM? Cause sure, I can understand that 

Is it because these two have NO connection and NO lead up to them realizing they like each other? Cause no, I canNOT understand that. Also, why did her best friend totally suck??

I didn’t HATE it, but I hate the hype. I expected this to be an absolute favorite and honestly it’s not even close. Adam was creepy. The steamy scene started off well and then was so cringe omg. I did laugh at some parts, like there were cute moments… but hanging out three times for max 10 minutes does not a relationship make

SO. Sorry 🤷🏼‍♀️ I wanted to love it for y’all I really did

Please tell me why you love this book!! I’d love to be convinced why it’s everyone’s favorite

We’re nearly 8 months in and I’m proud to say we’ve still not bought a single new piece of clothing for our baby.

What was really great this Christmas was how family got on board with our approach to gifting. Nieces and nephews went specifically to Les Bourgs to choose preloved clothing for him, and gifted on a book that they loved when they were younger. Grandparents got on board with the preloved gifts too and we’ve got some great items which will last a long time. We’re so thankful for everything we’ve received.

I know some people think we’re being awkward or annoying when we ask to avoid buying us/baby new things, but it’s something we’re passionate about and we’re so grateful when people understand and join in the preloved fun.

The Twin - Natasha Preston
⭐️⭐️

I am not easily disappointed by a book, but the only thing that got me through this one was the fact that I just wanted it to be over. I was too invested in the outcome of the story to DNF it, but I really felt no desire to continue reading… 

The synopsis of this story was intriguing; I know the concept of good twin v. evil twin is not a totally unique topic, but I, personally, had never read a story like that and was really looking forward to the “unputdownable read” that this thriller was marketed to be. I was incredibly bothered by both twins. In fact, there weren’t any characters that I really did like. At the beginning, the author does (kind of) have you guessing whether Iris is the master-manipulator her sister perceives her to be or whether Ivy is just a really unreliable mc, but it was made abundantly clear about halfway through the book. This not only took the “suspense” away, but it also had me even more frustrated with Ivy and Iris (and their dad, and their friends, and their teachers/principal/coach and their therapist…). I cannot express enough just how frustrated I was the entire time I was reading 😅 and the most bothersome part of it all, is how easily everyone in Ivy’s life started doubting her and, ultimately, gave up on her. It was just really unbelievable to say the least.

Honestly, I hate bashing books because I know someone poured their whole heart and soul into writing it but, this one was not for me.

💭 how often would you say you DNF books?

I can probably count on one hand how many books I’ve just given up on - in my whole life. I think I do it so seldom because I don’t really stray from my preferred genres so, mostly, every book I pick up, I know I will enjoy to some degree.

At this point, you may have noticed that I’m really not a fan of most holidays 🙃 Why? Because I believe the energy that goes into whatever is being “celebrated” on one day of the year should be occurring the other 364 days as well. (I also am NOT a fan of the profit over people narrative). 

Mothers are still mothers everyday, regardless of it’s a national holiday. They would LOVE acknowledgement, support, and celebration in all of the day to day things that they do. Mothers grow, carry, birth, and raise babies. Mothers make sure everyone has what they need - whether it’s shoes, lunches, snacks, hugs, kisses or snuggles. They think of EVERY. LITTLE. THING, every detail. 

The work that mothers do daily, inside and outside of their homes deserves more recognition from our society. Mothers are pure magic and our world simply would not function without them. 

Let’s work together as a society to raise the dang bar for support and love that mothers NEED to receive on a daily basis. And remember, supporting mothers also supports babies 😉✌🏼

17953328186515042;"UNPOPULAR OPINION: We have all heard the business coaching trope that we should pick 3 things our account will be about.

The general argument is that people won’t know or understand what you’re about if you add more than that to the mix.

They won’t know what to come to you for because it will confuse them.

I think that’s not giving people enough credit.

Like yeah, sure, some people will be confused and if so, they are not YOUR people.

If you are multi-passionate or your whole being is a big resounding NO to the idea of having to fit yourself into a neat little branding box, your people are also people like you and they will get it.

You can still put out your offers, which most likely will be around a few particular areas of expertise (which can also be diverse), and those people will get it.

They will want to buy from YOU.

I’m tired of this trope that doesn’t trust your ideal clients to get it.

What’s more, I’m tired of what this does to those of you for whom this advice doesn’t fit: it makes you share less.

You get lost in self-doubt having to narrow yourself down and, because you can’t decide, you show up as less YOU.

I’m a big believer that the strategy that will work for you is the one that works FOR YOU.

The one that you will actually follow through on.

This doesn’t mean that a more curated brand presence is a bad or wrong thing.

It’s the PERFECT thing for those who love curating their brand!

But if that’s not you, you have permission to free yourself from that ill-fitting advice.

You do you, babe.

The right people will get you.

The funniest part?

Once you throw this way of thinking off your shoulders, you will naturally evolve into sharing about the things you care about and a theme will emerge on its own.

Not from forcing it, but from the natural evolution of your expression, who you are and how you show up in the world.

Whether in life or in marketing, you don’t need to ‘shape’ yourself.

When you allow your essence to emerge through practicing self-acceptance, you will you be 10,000 times more magnetic AND it will feel authentic and in alignment.

What is the most overrated book you’ve ever read?

Before I continue, I’d like to point out that, as always, mine is just a very personal opinion that doesn’t aim at diminishing those who loved this book.

With a stellar Goodreads average of 4.59/5 stars and almost a million ratings, you can understand my expectations towards The Nightingale could not help but be very high.
I started this novel prepared to love it as many people have done before me but, alas, I had to DNF after reading the first half. And I’m not the kind of reader to often DNF books.

The story is slow, really slow.
The two lead sisters gave me pretty much nothing and I often found them annoying.
With great effort, I pushed myself to keep going, reading pages and pages of a novel that wasn’t able to carry me in its WWII France setting, because it didn’t feel real. Now, I am not a historian and I might know even less about France but, after having read comments from people who do know much about history and France and have read the book, I realised my feeling was right: there are a number of historical and narrative inaccuracies and inconsistencies that I think could’ve been fixed with a little more research and editing.

I might’ve overlooked it all, however, if the story had given me something, anything. Instead, what it left me with was a sense of disappointment and deep perplexity about the popularity of this novel. Too bad.
...
Qual è il libro più sopravvalutato che avete mai letto?

Prima di iniziare, ci tengo a specificare che questa è, come sempre, una mia personalissima opinione che non mira a sminuire chi questo libro l’ha amato.

Con una media Goodreads altissima di 4.59/5 e quasi un milione di valutazioni, potete ben capire che le mie aspettative verso L'Usignolo non potevano non essere alte.
Ho iniziato questo romanzo con l’intenzione di amarlo come hanno fatto tante altre persone prima di me ma, ahimè, arrivata a metà, ho dovuto abbandonare. E non sono il tipo da abbandonare spesso le letture.

La storia scorre lenta, molto lenta.
Le due sorelle protagoniste non sono riuscite a trasmettermi nulla, anzi le ho spesso trovate irritanti. (⬇️⬇️)";2022-03-21 16:24:54+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:40.031692+00:00;22;293;en

⭐️⭐️ All the Dangerous Things by Stacy Willingham 

Isabelle Drake's toddler son is kidnapped in the middle of the night, while she's asleep in bed with her (now ex-) husband. She's obsessed with finding her son, but she's suffering from debilitating insomnia and is a hot mess. A true crime podcaster expresses interest in her case, and Isabelle isn't sure who to trust anymore.

I *really* wanted to like this much more than I did. I was not the biggest fan of A Flicker in the Dark, but liked it just enough that I still wanted to read Willingham's second book. Some of the twists were fun, but I am deeply dubious of books with unreliable female narrators with wacky reasons for being unreliable (amnesia in particular, but insomnia is right up there -- though... I guess at least she wasn't a drunk?!?), and I found the whole thing to be a bit much, especially the way the super bonkers ending played out. 

I'm certain many readers will love this book, but I did not.

* Thank you to St. Martin's Press and Minotaur Books for the NetGalley review copy. All the Dangerous Things publishes January 10, 2023.

— 
I wrote down some long thoughts regarding changes and having an online presence ahead; feel free to skip if you’d like. 

I was asked a few times across my online art + personal spaces about why I did not go back to my past accounts, seeing as I had quite a decent following and many posts on those. I understand this question and agree that it may seem self-defeating and odd to make the switch at first glance. 

(Please note* :This is not to put down those who have asked this question; I just want to give my honest thoughts, and because it is a good question to reflect on for not only me but people who are thinking about it. I want to talk about it.) 

For myself, it comes down to many factors, and numbers are only one of the many. Whether it’s what I wanna convey about my work, changing relations + perception of social media, big life changes and therefore wanting to close that chapter in more tangible ways - aka leaving my old accounts - it feels that my heart and gut knows what it wants. I’ve also debated going back over the few months I was away from IG last year, and at this current moment, I can say that I stand by my decision to do what feels right for myself. 

You can have many followers and a large audience but still feel lonely.  Starting over feels right to me, and I want myself to be happy first and foremost. 

To not filter myself: change is inevitable and everyone will not exist at the end of the day. Everything is gonna be dust. Just do whatever makes you happy.

17963376155212425;"¡Hola bibliófilxs! 📨 Hoy vengo con una unpopular opinion. Me leí este libro hace meses, pero no había subido la reseña hasta ahora. “Piso para dos” está escrito por Beth O'leary y publicado por suma aunque yo tengo la edición DeBolsillo. 

¿Qué me ha pasado con este libro? Pues que no ha sido para mí y creo que han influido ciertos factores. 

Empecé a leerme este libro para desconectar un poco del TFM, pero al final acabé dándole un respiro porque solo podía permanecer concentrada en el trabajo. Y esto puede que haya supuesto un parón en la lectura y que me haya hecho perder el interés. Una vez, terminado el trabajo, volví a retomarlo, pero ahí me di cuenta de que no era por el TFM, era el libro. 

Me esperaba una ROMCOM más divertida, amena, con más tensión entre los protagonistas, pero no fue así. La parte de los post-it me pareció bastante larga, el personaje de Kay fue muy incongruente, según lo dibujaba la autora pensaba que actuaría de otra manera, Tiffy me sacó un poco de mis casillas, de Justin mejor no hablamos... Sin duda alguna, solo salvo a Leon, Richie y Holly.
 
La ambientación tampoco me dio para más. Es cierto que se puso algo más interesante de mitad hacia el final, pero para mí será un libro que ha pasado como quien ve llover, y de esos que con el tiempo olvidaré. La frase que mejor puede resumir mi opinión es “Esta novela es como la película de Antena 3 que ponen un sábado a las cinco de la tarde”. Entretenida pero hasta ahí. 

Antes de leer esta novela me llamaba la atención “En tus zapatos” pero ahora no sé si volveré a leer a la autora. ¿Qué opinan ustedes de “Piso para dos”? ¿Han leído ""En tus zapatos""?

¿Cómo estais preciosuras? Yo aquí sobreviviendo a duras penas 😆
Tenia muy pendiente subir esta reseña para cerrar (por fin) esta trilogía, que realmente dudo mucho  que lo sea por el final que ofrece esta tercera y ultima parte.

🍂No puedo explayarme todo lo que quisiera por culpa de los spoilers, tenéis de qué el primer libro en mi perfil, sinopsis y reseña.
Hoy hablemos de: 

⚔️ “Una promesa audaz y mortal”👑

🍃 El libro comienza tal y como terminó el anterior, al borde de una guerra inminente y aunque me costó bastante coger ritmo a la lectura, (cosa que también me pasó con dos anteriores  libros)al igual que en “Una maldición oscura y solitaria” y en “ Un corazón valiente y roto” , las ultimas 200 paginas son las que te confirman que estas leyendo una gran historia.

🍃Aunque a veces predecible, he disfrutado muchísimo de esos últimos capítulos cuando por fin se sucedían las cosas después de tanta preparación, la lectura pedía ritmo y casi en el último momento,ahí estaba.

🍂Enamorada de la trama de Grey y Lia Mara; Harper ya me pareció perfil mucho mas bajo en el segundo libro y al final, su momento confirmo que se encuentra en el primer libro; un personaje que fue  y es clave, es relegado por el “ segundón”, esto es un plow twist que al principio no me convenció pero que evidentemente después del segundo libro, estaba dentrisimo.

🍃Se ha acabado la trilogía y me sigue callando mal Rhen🙃 no le pillo…no se si el personaje o yo, pero no encuentro por donde cogerlo. 

¿Será posible que termine así esta historia? 

No sé si a l@os que lo hayáis leído os convence pero a mi me falta aún un poquito (bastante) mas, así que no me sorprendería que hubiera en un tiempo un spin-off que claramente leería gustosa. 

Hasta aquí estos cuatro personajes que por supuesto ya añoro, aunque siento que no ha sido la trilogía de mi vida. 

¿Que opináis por aquí?

Hidden Pictures by Jason Rekulak
Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️
>>>swipe for synopsis>>>

I don’t know if this was a case where this book got overhyped because people are gushing about it, but I found this just meh. Here is what worked for me and what missed the mark.

👍🏻The Good: 

The drawings were so creepy and including them in the book was very cool.

SLIGHT SPOILER: I appreciate when a book hints at paranormal happenings and actually follows through.

The story was genuinely spooky at times. 

👎🏻What Didn’t Work: 

I did not find the quality of the writing to be great. It read like a teen girl’s diary. 

Unreliable narrator trope and nothing unique or exciting was done with it. 

For so many reasons, the ending was absolutely insane. It was impossible to predict, and kept going on forever and getting crazier. I just didn’t love how it wrapped up.

17924128814549712;"✨Book Review (or rant, whatever)✨
The Sentence by Louise Erdrich
⭐️⭐️/5

I struggled with this one. I almost DNF it multiple times, but trudged on because it was a book club book. While I appreciate that there were spots that I liked (learning more about indigenous culture, a view from inside Minneapolis w during the protests after George Floyd’s murder), I had such a hard time reading it. Not because it was set in 2020, but because the writing was so choppy. It didn’t flow, and it felt like the author tried to shove as many themes and hot topics into one book as possible. Too many subjects that were brought up, with not enough depth to them. It was a bunch of surface scratching lines bantered about without being written about cohesively and with enough depth to garner empathy. 

So to boil it down, this was about Tookie, our strong FMC who works at a bookstore in 2020. Covid hit, and she wove in the pandemic fears. George Floyd was murdered and she wove in the pain and suffering from those marching, as well as those who had damages. Tookie is an indigenous person, and her family is exploring their culture and the bookstore she works at specializes in books about their history. Oh, and there’s a ghost that is haunting her at the bookstore that was an old customer. I know there’s more that I’m forgetting, even though I just finished the book, but it was so in-cohesive that the many bullet points she was going for got lost. Oh, and the thing that I disliked the most about this book? The writer put herself in the book (her literal name and person) as the owner of the bookstore. Also a random bit about her touring with her new book at the beginning of the pandemic when nothing was certain. I’m sure I had a WTF look on my face the entire time I read that. It came off as unnecessary and narcissistic.

This was a highly anticipated thriller for me and I was v excited with its potential in the beginning. Maybe the paranormal aspect lost it for me? Idk. I can also see why people enjoyed it. I truly think I’m out of my thriller era (for now) I’m just left disappointed. 😢

17962878089142890;"Suffering is a form of selfishness. 

We all experience pain in life but the degree to which we suffer is predicated on our perceptions. 

I’ve said it before, but…

SUFFERING = PAIN x RESISTANCE

According to TonyRobbins, suffering is obsession with self. We’re solely focused on what we’ve lost, what we have less of or what we’ve never had. 

The antidote? 

Accept what you HAVE and become grateful for it. 

Your suffering will diminish. 

This concept is simple (not easy!). 

The next time you experience suffering, ask yourself, “can I accept this and instead choose to move on?”.

Once I realised that the degree to which I suffered was in my control, it changed everything for me. 

I hope it can serve you in some small way too. 🧡

QOTD: What was the last book you read that you have an unpopular opinion about (positive or negative)? 

Review:

2.5 stars

This was an okay book, but there were things that kept me from really liking/engaging with it.

I liked that Blakely was fierce and strong and that her brothers were protective but not in an overbearing/excessive way. However, that was about it, and I found myself unable to connect any deeper with her or with Theo. I thought some of their banter/chemistry was interesting and felt mostly real, but there was something that kept me from really rooting for them - I think it was Theo's possessiveness and actions in a specific situation. 

I liked the secondary characters a lot more than the main characters, and I felt like the book could've been cut shorter, as I found myself skimming a lot of parts (like the college parties etc).

Overall, I think a lot of people will like this book as it has some good elements and popular tropes. I seem to be in the minority (according to GR), so I just don't think it's the book for me.

Thank you to Booksprout and Kelsie for gifting me an ARC in exchange for an honest review.

Ort: ein altes, uriges Cottage mit Blick auf die raue See, umgeben von blumigduftenden, wildromantischen Wiesen, dazu ein halbverfallenes Atelier im Garten. 

Stimmung: laue Sommerabende mit Wein, erstklassigen Speisen und tiefgründigen Gesprächen über Literatur, insbesondere über Poesie. 

Protagonisten:
Robert - ein armer Arbeiterjunge auf Wanderschaft, der seinem Schicksal im Bergwerk entfliehen möchte und der das Meer sehen will. Irgendwo in den Hügeln Nordenglands trifft er auf:
Dulcie - eine Lebefrau und Genießerin, unglaublich poetisch und ach so klug, predigt dem jungen Robert ununterlassen ihr Motto vor: Carpe Diem. 

Handlung: Robert findet schließlich beim Restaurieren des Ateliers unter Dielen einen gutversteckten Gedichtsband, und gemeinsam begeben er und Dulcie sich auf eine literarische Reise in die Vergangenheit.

Puh, ich mochte echt gar nichts an dem Buch. Dulcie war für mich einfach eine überhebliche Besserwisserin, altklug und einfach nur unsympathisch, schlicht: nervig. Robert blieb mir komplett fremd, spielt eine ziemlich devote und komplett unnahbare Rolle für einen Protagonisten.
Sprachlich hat es mich besonders genervt. Auch, wenn es zwischendurch mal nette Beschreibungen gab: es war mir von allem zu viel, zu gewollt schön, zu perfekt ausformuliert, zu ausgeknobelt, zu ausschweifend. Ich weiß, very unpopular opinion, aber für mich ein komplett zu Unrecht gelobtes Buch, das in einer perfekten Welt angesiedelt ist (natürlich mit Happy End, wie könnte es auch anders sein?) und das hauptsächlich unter dem folgendem Motto spielt: ""lebe dein Leben, denn zum Leben ist es ja da"". 

Und jetzt gleich noch upopular opinion Numero zwo hinterher: ""Der Perfekte Kreis"" fand ich sooso viel besser, aber der kam ja dafür bei den meisten nicht so gut weg. Und jetzt steinigt mich. 🙈

This book came highly recommended to me by multiple people, has been pretty hyped on booksta, was part of my “12 books recommended by 12 friends” challenge and I prefer more emotional romances over fluffy rom-coms so for all of those reasons I went into this book completely committed to falling in love with it but sadly this one just 𝐰𝐚𝐬𝐧’𝐭 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐦𝐞. 

Some things I did apprecite was how beautifully written it was in a reverse-timeline format. The entire premise is about a couple who has already ended their relationship when you begin the book and then you read in reverse about their journey of falling in love. While incredibly unique, it was a very slow burn and just left me feeling sad. Knowing the fate of the couple right away, I was still left rooting for our nameless MC and wanted more closure regarding her present/future journey. I did absolutely fall in love with “her” best friend though. Everyone needs a Maya in their life! 

I also want to warn that this is an incredibly sad read, with much heavier themes than my usual preferred emotional romances. There’s a trigger warning that really gutted me and I wish I’d looked it up prior, but I also appreciate some of the lesser-talked about topics that the author addresses. 

I read this back in January and have been conflicted about posting as I typically stick with reviews for books I loved, so while this is more of an 𝐮𝐧𝐩𝐨𝐩𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐫 𝐨𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐨𝐧, I do want to end with this…If this one has been on your TBR, I absolutely think you should read it for yourself.

So this happened, I read acotar. Here are two different scenarios:

1️⃣ Me: So, bookstagram, this one just wasn't for me. I'm sorry!
Bookstagram: Say you don't mean it!
Me: What...?
B: Swear on the cauldron! Say that acotar is your favorite book!
Me: ...
B: Now!

2️⃣ Me: So, booksta, acotar just wasn't for me...do you hate me?
B: Now, that's ok, we all like different things. That's what makes this fun! Of course, I would have liked it more if if you loved acotar, but that's fine. I'm sure not everyone loves your favorite books.
Me: Right... (Shoulders down, sighs in relief) So I don't have to swear on the cauldron?
B: What?
Me: Nevermind.

So, I'm hoping for scenario 2 🤞🏼

I love retellings, and 'Once upon a time' is one of my favorite shows. This one is a retelling of 'Beauty and the Beast'.
There's a big 'from rags to riches' storyline, dreamy faes, danger lurking in the shadows, and an ending that makes you interested in what happens next.

Somewhere in the middle I just realized it didn't appeal to me, because I don't think I'm the target audience for this one. I'm not a YA reader, I like to read more about the nerds better than the brutish hunky ones, there were too much ruminating, and the villain, who started out really good, didn't live up, to me.
The backstory of the villain was great, and I hoped for more when we got to meet her, maybe get an Evil Queen from OUAT storyline.

I found the male love interests too much toxic masculinity, so I hope the young audience don't go looking for guys like this, and only have book crushes on them.

It's still great that this gets the younger audience reading though, I feel like this is this generation's 'Twilight'. (Which I read when they came out)

What I liked: What happened to the MC, Feyre, in the end was pretty cool!
Her sister, Elain. I got some queer vibes from her. Am I right?
Lucien. I liked the scenes with him, and fun fact, my son's middle name is Lucien 🥰 And I love foxes.

Even though this one fell a little short for me, I am still curious about the second part. Should I read it?

I have no idea how to rate this. I'll leave the review with a cute 🌟

18226912846160338;"BOOK REVIEW

Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin

Unpopular opinion: not worth the hype. I firmly believe something can be a great piece of art/literature, and just not be for me! I personally did not think any of the characters were likable, except maybe Marx. Sadie and Sam were selfish, rude and stupid. There was nothing I liked about them, so I did not care for their friendship whatsoever. They both treated each other terribly, so I don’t understand how this book is some sort of wonderful take on friendship. The author used a lot of big, pretentious words that just were not necessary. There was a lot of information about video games, and that just didn’t interest me. This is obviously a very highly rated novel, so maybe there is something I am missing or just not comprehending. If you read this, what is your take on it? Did you like it? Did you like Sadie & Sam’s relationship? Let me know below!!

I’m in love with this book cover, but I wish I felt the same about this book. I know I shouldn’t judge a book by it’s cover, but I had read a lot of amazing reviews about this one before starting. It’s funny because I used to LOVE fantasy books as a young adult, but now I just trudge through them and get bored. I started this one at the end of January and am only just finishing it. I did appreciate how the author plays with letters, words and language to tell the story, and how Doors lead to new worlds. I couldn’t get hooked and felt this one dragged on for me. Just not my cup of tea. Another unpopular opinion by yours truly.

The novel has many issues from plots holes to lacking any dramatic arc. The issues become more evident because the characters are unidimensional and inconsistent. 

If the above wasn’t enough, the novel is filled with very cheesy morality lessons and phrases that look out of life couch’s Twitter account, that for a moment I thought Paulo Cohelo was the writer of the book 😂 🙊.

I do get why there’s a big hype around this book and people love it. The book intends to tell a hopeful and inspiring story. It is easy to read and to get hooked by it (I ended up finishing it even though I didn’t like it). Unfortunately, I just didn’t connect with it. The perfect example of ‘it’s not you, it’s me’, I guess 🤷🏽‍♂️

📖 Lauren and Ryan are a married couple, childhood sweethearts until they no longer are. Things are tense and they decide to separate for a year and find out whether they still want to be together after that. 

💭 There are positive and negatives when it comes to my feelings for this book. I loved Lauren’s family, her mum, grandma and sister are all wonderful characters with different layers to them that I enjoyed reading. Lauren’s friendship with Mila was also a highlight for me. 

👎🏼 I think this may be the first time I’ve had anything negative to say about a TJR book but I found the romance side of things a little predictable. Maybe I’m a cynic but I love her usual books for the stand out female characters, who make there own way and yes, Lauren’s narrative took that direction at points but I felt disappointed when the book finished. 

Usually TJR books make me feel something and this had potential but just didn’t have the same effect. 

RATING: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ 

I still love TJR but this one didn’t live up to expectations for me. Not in the same way Daisy, Evelyn, Carrie and Malibu Rising did.

Es el primer libro que leo de la autora y se nota muchísimo la calidad que tiene como escritora, pero para mí la historia se quedó demasiado corta.

Levi y Vi se conocen en un funeral cuando tenían apenas 8 y 10 años. Se convierten en los mejores amigos del mundo. El chico del futuro brillante y la chica rara que quiere cumplir su sueño. Ambos tienen aspiraciones muy diferentes y su amistad evoluciona a algo más. 

Es un libro que me recuerda muchísimo (MUCHÍSIMO) a Evelyn Hugo, excepto por la parte de la infancia de los protagonistas, Violet me daba muchísimas vibras a Evelyn y no me ha gustado esa parte.

El childhood friends to lovers siempre es un acierto, pero es que en este libro me dio la sensación de que las cosas eran muy forzadas. Las relaciones de los protagonistas y los secundarios destilan MUCHA vida, pero es que no me dieron la sensación de realidad.

Estoy segura de que este libro podría haberlo disfrutado en otro momento de mi vida, pero me apetecía mucho leerlo por las buenas críticas que leía y fue un error.

Aunque sea el primer libro que leo de la autora, sé que no me voy a rendir con ella porque simplemente no me ha gustado esta historia. 

1,5/5⭐️

Ojalá vosotras sí hayáis disfrutado mucho de este libro ❤️

Running Wild - K. A. Tucker
🌟🌟

LIKES
☀️ While I really didn’t like this story, K.A. Tucker is a phenomenal writer.
☀️ The rare glimpses of Jonah and Calla.

DISLIKES
🌙 There’s genuinely next to no romances where I’ve sensed less of a spark between the main characters than these two. The will they won’t they didn’t pay off because I literally did not care.
🌙 Plot? What plot? 
🌙 Characters with less depth than a piece of paper.
🌙 Marie’s non-stop dreary, pushy, needy, woe is me attitude. I got sick to death of her claiming she likes Calla whilst being bitchy about her and continuously all over Jonah. She wasn’t likeable in The Simple Wild, and she still isn’t now.
🌙 The ending was one big eye roll.

Unless you’re a huge fan of husky racing, you’ll be fine. But if you want romance, honestly read anything but this. K.A has much better stories with much better characters!

Have you read this series? Thanks to _inventoryofstories_ for reading all of them with me and to jen.reads.while.tipsy for gifting this to me. I’m sorry I didn’t love it but I hope this review makes you laugh 😂💕

17976189193954160;"#bookstagrammademedoit What's your take on Taylor Jenkins Reid? She seems to be a beloved author on here. Yet I had never heard of her before Bookstagram. I buddy read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo in November, and just buddy read Malibu Rising.

I'll start with the positive:

Part I was engrossing and I grew attached to the characters, especially Nina, and her mum June.
The flashbacks to the Riva's childhood, and their mum's love story with Mick, were excellent.
It was fun to see some references to characters from EH
All the surfing descriptions didn’t put me off, even though I've never surfed (ironic, since I lived in Australia for a year!)
TJR tackled similar themes in both books such as alcoholism, fame, parenting, misogyny, poverty, family (blood and chosen), as well as queerness, and overall, it is well tackled.

Now for what bothered me (very mild spoilers):

So.many.characters. in Part II! WHY? I really didn't care about all the various party-goers, the ensuing mayhem, all the drug-taking and making out and smashing everything. 

So.many.descriptions of clothes and faces and bodies. I am reading a book, not watching a fashion show...!
Nothing much happened plot-wise. No big twist. It was all wrapped up nicely. No epilogue or ""10 years later"" chapter.

I appreciate what TJR is doing, in her books, with her portrayal of women trying to make it in a man's world. But she tries to include references to racism, without outright going into it, so it seems disingenuous. (See last quote to see what I mean… There is nothing revolutionary in saying that the police is more polite to rich white people - duh) One of the characters definitely would have been singled out by the police due to his skin colour, in the 80s, but in there, the police ignores him!?

Some of the side characters read like one-dimensional clichés, and I really didn't care what might happen to them.

I saw the ""twist"" about Kit coming from a mile off.

Tough to rate - the first half would be 4 stars, second half 2.5? It did seem more realistic and less centered on one character than EH, but, meh.

⭐️⭐️⭐️💫 (3.25)

17986037752466314;"If you’re vegan and think it’s ok to ride horses, how do you then convince people it’s not ok to ride elephants, camels, llamas, cows, donkeys, dolphins etc? 
.
To use any animal for our own entertainment is exploitation, and therefore not vegan. Exploitation does not necessarily mean abuse, it means using someone else for your own benefit. 

Jemma Crosby has been vegan for two years. After being involved in dressage for several years as a junior rider, she recently gave up the sport. She says: “When I became vegan, I stopped riding horses – in the same way I stopped eating animals and wearing wool and leather. When you become vegan, you stop exploiting animals, and that may involve giving up things you have previously enjoyed doing. I believe animals are not ours to use. For me, veganism is about animal rights, and the steps some riders will take to reduce harm to the horse i.e. not using a metal bit, or a whip, are animal welfare steps. It is better than treating the animal badly, but it does not actually adhere to the vegan ideology.” 

“I accept that many riders do love horses, and do treat them well. I also believe if someone rescues an abandoned or abused horse, it is good to give the animal a good, safe home. I’m not blinkered, and realise as long as we live in a world where people do use animals, there will always be a need to provide sanctuary”.

“But I don’t believe vegans should buy into, or promote that market by ‘buying’ or ‘owning’ horses. Ultimately, using a horse for riding, you are exercising control and ownership over an autonomous, independent animal, and that goes against everything veganism is about.”

17985300055566032;"""You are raising a kind child"", was what I was told by Viaan's teacher at our recent Parent Teacher Meeting. And honestly, that's probably the best compliment anyone has ever given me. 
.
Because a 'kind' person helps make this world more beautiful by simply existing in it, right? And when you realise you're raising one? Nothing can compare! 🥺❣️
.
BUT here's the thing...Kindness doesn't always matter. There..I said it. 
.
Don't get me wrong. Kindness is SO important in many situations. I'll forever be less concerned with Viaan's academics, and more concerned with how he treats people with respect and kindness. But...
.
...but, I'm also hoping to raise Viaan to recognise when kindness just won't cut it. I do love quotes that circulate, like, ""In a world where you can be anything....be kind."" It seems simple. But here's the truth. Often, kindness isn't enough. 
.
You see, in my opinion, kindness is more inspirational than motivational. Read that again.
Kindness helps you create relationships, but it doesn't foster them. Kindness might open the door, but you will definitely need more than kindness to keep that door open. Kindness will help make peace, but will never be enough to keep it.
.
And while I would want Viaan to consider kindness first, I would want him to consider the situation foremost. Not every situation would warrant his kindness. As he grows, he will find himself in tricky situations..where it may be more sensible to not extend an open hand and rather lay down an iron fist instead! There are going to be people that he will meet, with a sharp tongue rather than a sweet word. I hope he learns to trust his gut. And as long as he chooses his words and actions wisely, and with good intention, he will never fall short. 
.
That's called integrity. And I hope Viaan never compromises his integrity for the sake of kindness. 
.
So while I continue to focus on raising a child who will hopefully make this world a better place, I unfortunately cannot not focus on toughening him up to face a harsh world :( 
.
So yes, kindness matters....but just maybe not always.
.

Kalau ada yang bilang habis nikah itu masa yang enak dan kayak #honeymoon, menurut saya secara emosi, ketenangan batin dan kemampuan adaptasi serta regulasi emosi dinamika berdua pasangan lebih kerasa enak di 1.5 tahun pertama setelah menikah daripada sebulan pertama. 

1.Dengan catatan kami berdua sama-sama SADAR kalau “marriage relationship” is a hardwork. Butuh NIAT, USAHA dan INTENSI setiap hari, dari menit-menit komunikasi dan interaksi sehari-hari untuk bisa punya #BidsOfConnection. 

2. Saya ambil bagian untuk memproses/healing #childhoodtrauma terkait relasi pernikahan orangtua karena udah memroses sebagian besar dari sebelum nikah aja TETEP masih bisa ketrigger sampe sesek napas, cemas berlebihan atau muncul psikosomatis karena trauma ketrigger. #CPTSD detected. 

3. Belajar dan ngerasain kalau #RelasiSehat itu relasi yang biasa-biasa aja, sehari-hari dan bosen/mundane yang diurus jadi penting berlatih mindset gimana bisa ngerasa Happy dan damai dari hidup yang BIASA-BIASA aja. JUSTRU kalau kamu punya relasi romantik sama #narcissistic personality relasi kamu rasanya kayak roller coaster, ekstrim kayak di langit ketujuh dengan #LoveBombing Lalu ekstrim kamu dighosting, dia menghilang atau nganggep kamu ekstrim nggak berharga kayak keset yang bisa diinjak-injak. 

4. Terus menerus secara aktif MENCARI MAKNA HIDUP dari diri sendiri, dari aktivitas, karya dan pekerjaan yang dilakukan karena pasangan NGGAK BISA mengisi kekosongan makna hidup di dalam diri kita. Harus kita sendiri yang TAU CARA mengisi #MaknaHidup. 

“Karena dengan terus mengusahakan perasaan utuh, penuh dan cukup sama diri baru kita bisa berbagi kepenuhan hidup, kepenuhan diri #selffulfiling dan good-enough relationship”

5. Mengenali dan membangun #supportsystem dari spend time sama keluarga lalu jadi bahan obrolan dan diskusi tentang Value/nilai hidup, bantuan mama yg kirim makanan, bantuan tukang buat benerin rumah, bantuan mbak buat Bersihin rumah seminggu sekali, bantuan tukang sampah dan Bu RT buat dititipin barang kalo lagi nggak di rumah, dsb.

Whether you hate a book everyone loves, or love a book most people feel lukewarm about, your opinions are completely valid! 

There isn't a single book out there that every person will love or agree on. I personally appreciate seeing different types of reviews and hearing other reader's opinions. I think it makes for a more interesting conversation and can shed light on aspects of a book you may not have noticed. 

I am always honest in my reviews, but will also try to be courteous and thoughtful when writing about books I did not enjoy.

Favorite quote: “People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”

I love Old Hollywood compared to Hollywood today. Cary Grant, Grace Kelly, Sophia Loren, iconic and classic. I actually can’t stand today’s Hollywood “elite.” I don’t follow or care about gossipy magazines (is that even a thing anymore?) So initially I was hesitant reading this knowing the synopsis and not typically the book I would gravitate towards. I heard so many good things about this book and I’ll be honest, I had a fear of missing out so I caved. This book is so widely loved on bookstagram so I had very high expectations going in, I’m sorry but I just don’t see the hype 😩

“The media are going to tell whatever story they want to tell. They always have. They always will.” 

Yes. Quite a few people in the real world who need this awakening and discernment. People will blindly follow the media and think that’s the truth. No, it’s just the “media’s truth” they want to show you.

I think this was a solid character-driven plot and overall an entertaining soap opera gossipy style story with some twists and turns to keep the reader invested, but I didn’t fall head over heels for this one as much as I wanted to. I really enjoyed her short story Evidence of the Affair much more. 

It felt too contrived and soulless. A social agenda for hot-button issues. I appreciate what she was going for, but it just didn’t hit the mark for me. I think it’s fitting for me to reiterate that quote, “I’m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.” 🤷🏼‍♀️";2022-04-05 20:57:22+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:46.449846+00:00;100;464;en

⭐️⭐️⭐️.75

Read this book if you like:
👩‍🔬women in STEM
🐱people who like cats
✨enemies to lovers 
🫶 a socially awkward FMC
🧠grumpy MMC

What I loved:
Bee is the perfect amount of socially awkward/hard on herself for all the wrong reasons and I REALLY connected with her on that front. This book was just the right amount of cheesy romance, while also reminding us that there are still far too many gender inequalities happening considering it’s 2023 (hello gender wage gaps🙃) and Levi Ward… well we don’t deserve him. And neither does his family. 

What I didn’t love:
I really wanted to give this 4 stars, but considering all the other 4 star books I’ve read lately I just couldn’t do it😅 that’s not to say I didn’t enjoy it, because I did, but I felt the first 150 pages to be QUITE slow, and all the good stuff.. well we could have had so much more of it!! I also predicted the ending to an extent from the very beginning, which I hope doesn’t happen for everyone! Some of you might find this review a little too blunt, but I promised I would always be honest in my reviews🤷🏼‍♀️

18004235692512552;"💣 Unpopular statement: ""Buyers are not logical, they are psychological.""

I explain:

While as buyers we are capable of logical thought and reasoning, our decision-making and behaviors are also influenced by a wide range of psychological factors such as emotions, motivations, personality, past experiences, cultural background, and social influences.

For example, a person may make a decision that seems illogical to an outsider because they are driven by their emotions or motivated by something that is important to them personally. Similarly, a person's past experiences can shape their beliefs and behaviors in ways that may not always be logical to others.

👸🏼 🐎 

Was war das letzte Buch, was ihr 2022 beendet habt? Bei mir war es #sisi von #karenduve .

Es ist schon eine kleine Tradition geworden Weihnachten nicht nur die alten Sisi Filme aus dem 50ern mit Romy Schneider zu sehen, sondern auch neue Bücher über Sisi zu lesen. Als Sisi-Liebhaberin und Historikerin ist es manchmal gar nicht so einfach gute zu finden. Entweder sind sie historisch ungenau, romantisiert, verkitscht oder alles auf einmal. 
🐎
Da mir dieses Buch oft empfohlen wurde und es all das nicht beinhalten sollte, habe ich es zusammen mit Lisa the.literarycorner gelesen und was soll ich sagen, ich wurde bitter enttäuscht. 🙈
💄 
Besonders der Anfang ist zäh, da man Mitten ins Geschehen geworfen wird und die Schilderungen sehr oberflächlich sind. Seiten über Seiten wird nur das Äußere der Kaiserin und ihrer Hofdamen beschrieben. Nur dünne Personen seien etwas wert und welche die schöne Kleider tragen. 🙈😅

Ich hätte das Buch da eigentlich abgebrochen, weil es zudem langweilig war und die Kaiserin, die einen sehr komplexen Charakter besaß, sehr eindimensional dargestellt wurde. Natürlich unterlag sie einem Schönheitswahn und war eitel, aber sie war so viel mehr. 

Es entwickelt sich keine wirkliche Handlung, hat zu viele Figuren und die Erzählung erstarrt in seiner beobachtenden Haltung. Der lakonische Tonfall verhindert zudem eine Identifikation mit der Monarchistin und der explizite Fokus, auf den von der Kaiserin so geliebten Reitsport ist zudem eher etwas für Liebhaber.

Man braucht wirklich viele Seiten, um das Konstruktionsprinzip von „Sisi“ zu verstehen und die verschiedenen Ebenen des Textes auseinanderzuhalten, um gute Seiten zu entdecken, wie die interessanten Perspektiven. Eine genauere Historizität, gute Recherchearbeit, die nicht romantisierte Darstellung Sisis, die ungewöhnliche Erzählweise, dass man Neues lernt, Sisi aus der Sicht ihres Umfeld kennenzulernen und der satirische Blick auf die eitle Hofgesellschaft sei positiv hervorzuheben. 
Aber es überwiegen für mich die negativen Seiten und daher kann ich keine Empfehlung aussprechen. 🙈Wirklich sehr schade.

Wie hat es euch gefallen ?";2023-01-04 17:39:58+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:46.482376+00:00;35;219;de

Ever since I heard some cover songs with the vocalo changer,  examp: Tora V4 Gumi AI cover of All I want for Christmas, its been a disgusting disgrace. Yeah its very interesting that Yamaha is deciding to do this but... Its like what's the point in taking the time to tune manually if people r gonna choose this ""next big thing""; its gonna make their work lazy and messy. New vocaloid users should take the time and effort to tune these loids and put love into it. This vocalo changer is gonna make the newer ppl of vocaloid lose motivation and interest in trying. Plus, if old, big producers use it, I predict its gonna worsen their talent in what they do. I'd rather give respect to the producers who stay with what they're doing and avoid than the ones who'll choose to use it and become lazy in their work (I'm gonna call it the Tora V4 effort for now on)

18011496958516480;"#unpopularopinion: motivation is overrated. 
If you wait to be motivated, you will never hit your goals. Motivation comes and goes. But committing to consistency? That’s when the changes happen. 

Commit to yourself. Whether it’s creating a reel per day, working out, drinking water or meeting 3 new people this week. And don’t let your head hit your pillow until you did what you committed to do. 

And slowly, that choice becomes habit.

🚨 Unpopular Opinion 🚨

 ""If your mother is the love of your life, what does that make your husband?""

Katy is 30 years old when her mother passes.  She suddenly no longer wants to be married, decides her mother abandoned her without giving her the tools to live without her, and then flies off to Italy, leaving her husband, Eric, behind.

Upon arriving in Italy, she simply forgets he exists. Katy does not appreciate, nor respect, him as she jaunts around Italy like she is a single woman. This REALLY irked me and I almost DNF'd.

Carol (Katy's mom) appears as her 30 year-old self to Katy while she is wandering around Italy. 
They begin spending time together, and one day Katy finds out something that puts her in a panic, and she blows up at Carol.  She is in shock that her mother had a life and feelings outside of her and she spirals.

There are parts of the story I can't speak on or it will spoil the overall read but it's these factors that really turned me off this book. I couldn't connect with Katy at all and just did not like her. I will say I loved all the descriptions of Italy ... the scenery, the food, and the atmosphere. Can I just go there now please 😂

I am so sad to say that I really really didn’t like this book. Especially because I adore the author and absolutely loved The Perfect Marriage. But this one…was not for me. 
•
For the first 60-70% it felt like a romance, not a thriller. The characters were extremely unlikeable. Even with first person POVs for both, everything felt superficial. 
•
The twist was clever but did not feel very flushed out. And the ending seemed rushed and forced. I was extremely bummed by the whole book.

17952003430950609;"❤How is your reading going this month?
Great reads or disappointing ones?

I seem to be dishing 1 and 2 star reviews like candies at trick or treat. And this here is one of those books.

🐻🍯Bear's Honey by Tamrin Banks
My rating: 1 star ⭐

🍯It started going downhill from page 2. The 35 year old curvy librarian is admiring the 29 year old famous chef who just appeared in the doorway. First time she sees him of course and she checks him out. His 'big, broad chest covered by a black T-shirt and a black leather motorcycle jacket', as well as 'his slim hips and thick thighs covered by slim blue jeans that hug his glorious ass.'

🐻*Cue scratching head and wondering* - she's admiring his chest - covered by the jacket. If the jacket were open and I'd see those yummy pecs and maybe a 6 pack (not 8 cause I'm not greedy)... that would be a totally different story - drooling allowed anytime at hot man candy.
But how the heck is she seeing all that through the jacket!? And then checking out his 'glorious ass' when he's facing her in that doorway! Perhaps she has some sort of X Ray vision, Superman style? But then it would have to curve around the guy to zero in on his ass!

🐻Question not answered but never mind. Moving on. To page 3, and the guy's POV, which makes me literally roll my eyes with a muttered. Oh come on! Are you shitting me?!

🍯'I saw her picture on the inside flap and that was it. She was my destiny. The woman I've been looking for my whole life. She's a goddess. A siren pulling me closer to devastation on the rocks or heaven lost in her arms.'
🐻Boy! That must have been a really special picture! For a guy to realise she's his destiny!
But truth be told his bar must have been quite low, because just 2 pages later he realises 'she's so much more than he expected. Fiery, beautiful and smart. What a dangerous tempting combination!'

🐻You really need to get your priorities straight boyo, if you consider your destiny to be a very sexy but daft goddess! To each their own I guess.

🍯The chemistry between them hits off from the start in a bit vulgar type of courting...

17921668022080967;"This may be an unpopular opinion and I certainly am not meaning to upset any professionals working as dog walkers or at daycares, many of whom I like and respect, but I am finding that the majority of dogs I work with that suffer with fear based reactivity either go to daycare or with a dogwalker (or both). I’m not saying it is the cause of the issue but it could be a contributing factor. 

Maybe this isn’t the environment for all?
Whilst some may be able to cope with this fine there are some that just cannot - and it may not be obvious to their guardians because they seem to have such fun!

The truth is some are just so over stimulated and unrested, some shut down and hide their stress and some let it all out when they’re home, or the next day when they’re out on a walk with their guardian. Or the day after (cortisol, the stress chemical sits in the body for days). 

Many come home so wired and appear super-hyper at home so to counter that they get sent to daycare or with the group dogwalker the next day to burn it off and up and up the stress levels go. For a dog that is struggling, walking sandwiched between a few dogs can be quite hellish. 

I understand the need for daycare, especially when separation anxiety can be so tricky to manage. If your dog is really struggling maybe consider seeking out an alternative arrangement with a human where they are the only dog, or maybe a calm other dog that they can hang with? Or seek out professional help with the separation anxiety?

A cortisol holiday can a game changer. Give your dog a few days off the daycare or from the walker and see if there is a difference? 

Also do your homework and make sure the staff know what they’re doing, ask about ratios, body language awareness, do they promote force-free techniques (water spraying is still an aversive and must be avoided etc etc.

- Reminders of Him
A young mother, Kenna is released from prison and hopes to reunite with her daughter while forming a relationship with bar owner, Ledger. 
Plenty of cheesy moments in this one but also some heartfelt ones. The ending felt a bit rushed and I enjoyed it overall. An easy read that’ll give you a dose of escapism ⭐️⭐️⭐️ 

- Every Last Secret 
Enjoyed this one but didn’t love it! Essentially it’s about two women who go head-to-head as one tries to steal the other’s husband. It explores how far the women are willing to go to get what they want. Slightly predictable but I enjoyed seeing it play out and seeing who “won”. If you love the drama of Desperate Housewives you’ll probably enjoy this ⭐️⭐️⭐️ 

If you’ve read either of these let me know what you thought!

Yuyao synthv would b such a great match  with Aiko as well, especially for a commission song (I'm into yuyao synthv; wasn't at first) if he actually used yuyao instead of aiko and kept Haiyi and miku; would've been a beautiful song.

You shouldn’t expect your team to work in your business as if it was their own. 

Yes you should have expectations of behaviour and performance and yes they should be focused at work and achieving these expectations with your support and leadership. 

But this doesn’t mean they should be putting in copious amounts of unpaid overtime, working through lunch break, or checking their emails as soon as they wake up.

Don’t get me wrong, some staff will still do these things even if you encourage them not to, but these kinds of metrics shouldn’t be what you’re using to assess whether your team are working hard, are the right fit for your business or should be offered a pay rise or promotion.

* cytat z wstępu do nowego wydania

Bardzo lubię twórczość Marty Dzido. Moim ulubieńcem jest zmysłowy zbiór opowiadań ""Sezon na truskawki"" o kobiecości i seksualności. W ""Matrioszce"" zachwycałam się grami słownymi i poruszaniem problemu alkoholizmu w rodzinie, przekazywania traum z pokolenia na pokolenie.

Natomiast ""Ślad po mamie"" okazał się dla mnie sporym rozczarowaniem. Poznajemy tu historię dziewczyny, która żałuje dokonania aborcji i próbuje się z tym zmierzyć. 

""Ślad po mamie"" to wznowienie debiutu autorki z 2002 roku. Po ponad 20 latach ukazuje się ponownie. I niestety literacko jest naprawdę kiepsko - sztywne dialogi, górnolotne metafory, zupełnie rozminęłam się ze stylem pisania. Kreacja bohaterów również nie była dla mnie satysfakcjonująca. Portrety psychologiczne są płaskie, zabrakło pogłębienia emocji bohaterów. 

Lektura nie wzbudziła we mnie żadnych emocji oprócz przewracania oczami. To z pewnością jest to ważna i potrzebna pozycja, która nadal jest aktualna. Do mnie niestety nie trafiła. Widać, że autorka zrobiła naprawdę duży progres w pisaniu. ""Sezon na truskawki"" jest świetny i bardzo zachęcam do sięgnięcia po ten zbiór. ""Ślad po mamie"" niestety mnie rozczarował. Chętnie przeczytałabym nowy tekst o aborcji w wykonaniu autorki.

I have heard very little positive comments about toxic positivity from people. Very rarely do I hear praise about being given toxic positivity

The desire to share and prevent pain of others, is a natural instinct for many supporters and caregivers. It’s only natural to have compassion for another who is suffering

I’ve been guilty of it a lot myself. From being on both the receiving end and giving end of toxic positivity, I have reflected and created a resource of my thoughts on the topic.

17884136678596880;"👗 LA SÉLECTION 👗

Hello #bookstagramfrance 👑 Je vous l’ai dit dans mon dernier post : je ne lis rien en ce moment. Je vous retrouve donc ce soir pour vous donner mon avis sur un roman très populaire que j’ai lu l’année dernière : La Sélection de Kiera Cass. 

America Singer est l’héroïne de ce roman. Inscrite d’office à la « Sélection » par sa mère, America est choisie bien malgré elle pour participer à cette télé-réalité dans laquelle 35 candidates sont mises en compétition pour conquérir le cœur du Prince Maxon et devenir reine consort. Sauf que America est déjà amoureuse d’Aspen, un soldat de la caste inférieure. Puis elle rencontre enfin le jeune Prince et ses plans sont bouleversés…

Je vous préviens : cette chronique ne sera pas du tout élogieuse. Le gros problème, c’est que j’ai lu ce roman à 25 ans alors qu’il est davantage adapté à la lectrice de 15 ans que j’étais d’après moi. Pour commencer, le trope du triangle amoureux est devenu pratiquement rédhibitoire pour moi, surtout lorsqu’on devine tout de suite qui la fille va choisir. Ensuite, j’ai beaucoup de mal avec le concept de 35 jolies filles en robes de bal qui vont se tirer dans les pattes pour le Prince et le titre qui l’accompagne. On se croirait dans le Bachelor. Je vous épargnerai mon discours féministe mais cette intrigue c’est un NON. 

America Singer est l’un des personnages les plus antipathiques, égoïstes et tellement puériles que j’ai rencontrés. Maxon est beau, fade et gentil. Tous les personnages secondaires ont des caractères clichés peu développés. Tout le worldbuilding est quasiment inexistant et le peu qui est présent est si absurde et plein d’incohérences. Je ne comprends pas du tout comment ce roman peut-être vendu ainsi : « quand la dystopie rencontre le conte de fées ». Où est la dystopie ? On est loin des classiques du genre à la Hunger Games. Mon unique compliment pour ce roman, c’est qu’il se lit facilement et rapidement !

Ever since deco made Zombies, not many deco songs have been speaking to me lately. When I heard Poison Apple, I was so amazed by how good it was. But nobody talks about the song. I feel like barely any ppl know it and its sad bc its such a good song😭

Agree or Disagree? Write down in the comments

Admin thoughts: Firstly I like Deco but I gotta say Poison Apple is just so much better than Zombies (It's not a bad song but it sounds like it was supposed to be on Mannequin) imo idk how it's the one that gets less attention

Dieses Buch habe ich im #Buddyread mit melissa_schreibt und nightflower_reads gelesen. Danke für den Austausch! ♥😊

❓ Q. Welches Hype-Buch hat euch zuletzt enttäuscht ❓ 😕

📚 Zitat: „Sobald die Zukunft jedoch erste einmal geweissagt wurde, wird sie lebendig, und sie wird hart darum kämpfen, wahr zu werden.“ E-Book, Seite 18 📚

Mein #FederFazit 📖 zu #Legendary von #StephanieGarber: 

🔸 In Begeisterungsstürme ließ mich Teil 1 damals zwar nicht ausbrechen, doch er hat mich dennoch einige Stunden lang gut unterhalten. 😊🙌 Als mir dann von allen Seiten versichert wurde, dass der zweite Band der beste der ganzen Reihe sei und ich mir den auf keinen Fall entgehen lassen dürfe, war schnell klar, dass für mich auch an der Fortsetzung kein Weg vorbeiführen würde. 🫡

🔸 Doch was steckt hinter dem Hype? Ist das Buch wirklich so großartig, wie alle sagen? 🤔 Dem kann ich leider nicht zustimmen, denn wenn ich die Lektüre in einem Wort zusammenfassen müsste, wäre das ein ziemlich ernüchtertes: Meh. 🤷🏼‍♀️😅 Die Fortsetzung ist sicher nicht schlecht, sie ist nur leider auch nicht besonders GUT (keine Sorge, Antrag auf Aufnahme ins Zeug*innen-Schutzprogramm ist nach dieser Rezension raus 🙊😜). „Legendary“ ist daher für mich leider nur ein mittelmäßiger Band 2, von dem ich mir deutlich mehr erhofft habe. 😐

🔸 Doch zuerst zu den positiven Seiten: Sehr gut gefallen hat mir erneut der bildhafte, blumige Schreibstil, der sich wieder unheimlich angenehm lesen lässt. 😍 Die synästhetischen Beobachtungen von Scarlett (z. B. Gefühle, die Farben haben) haben mir zwar gefehlt, aber ansonsten beweist Stephanie Garber ein weiteres Mal, dass sie den Blick fürs Besondere hat und sehr gut und filmisch schreiben kann. Erneut präsentiert uns die Autorin eine Fülle kreativer Einfälle, magischer Orte und fantasievoller Gegenstände und zeigt, dass ihr die Ideen noch lange nicht ausgehen. Genau das liebe ich an dieser Reihe! ❤️

🔸 Außerdem gibt es aus feministischer Sicht nicht viel zu kritisieren [...]

I found this book to be slow, it did not capture my interest, nothing was “thrilling”, I wasn’t into the writing style, and didn’t care for the characters. 🥶 The only thing I found interesting was the author actually climbed this mountain herself. 

I didn’t DNF this book only because I had these cool pics to post. I’ve had an awesome time in Colorado this week with family. Hope you all had a nice Thanksgiving!

17968314599045423;"[Unpopular opinion. And a long review ! 💫]
I am so glad I finally finished this reading ! This is obviously my opinion but I am very aware that plenty of people do not share my views !
I loved the first book so much and slightly less the second book. Well the third was as long to read as the second book ! I found the first 200 pages so long to read ! So many emotion (too many !!), the characters are self centred and I felt like nothing happened (except my growing frustration). And then something switch and I  loved the second part ! The characters are less boring, the action and humor are back and I truly liked the end. I still do not like Lia Mara though, that I find boring and pointless 😬.
What do you think of the book ??
•
Je suis tellement contente d'avoir enfin terminé cette lecture ! Il s'agit de mon opinion et je suis totalement consciente que beaucoup de gens ne partageront pas mon point de vue ! J'avais tellement aimé le premier roman, un peu moins le deuxième. Ce troisième tome a été aussi long à lire que le précédent ! J'ai trouvé les 200 premières pages tellement longues à lire ! Tellement d'émotions (mais trop !), des personnages centrés sur eux-mêmes et pas grand chose ne se passe (sauf ma frustration grandissante). Et puis quelque chose change et j'ai adoré la seconde partie (après les 200/230 premières pages). Les personnages sont moins ennuyeux, l'action et l'humour sont de retour et j'ai beaucoup aimé la fin. En revanche je déteste toujours Lia Mara, que je trouve ennuyeuse et inutile 😬.
Que pensez-vous de ce livre ??

17942700590416825;"I read a fair amount of books in the horror genre, which is broad and can lend itself to a lot of really wonderful characters and worlds and stories. After reading Grady Hendrix’s THE FINAL GIRL SUPPORT GROUP in December, I eagerly clicked over to NetGalley to request an advance copy of HOW TO SELL A HAUNTED HOUSE. By all accounts, I thought I would enjoy this book too. This cover is fantastic and the premise is intriguing: two siblings are forced to deal with the death of their parents, who left them a house which is apparently haunted, while also trying to reconcile their own relationship.

Let me tell you, I was wrong.

I rarely dislike a book this much. And I’m really not saying this to be mean. I’m just pretty good about picking out books I’ll enjoy at this point in life. Maybe I’m missing something here, because I’ve seen nothing but rave reviews on this one, but it just didn’t work for me.

I forced myself through it because I have issues with DNFing. (I never want to let the book win!) It just got more outlandish with every chapter, which I realize was the point—it’s campy like a bad horror movie on purpose—but it came off as far too self-indulgent for me. The best part was the sibling relationship between Louise and Mark, the play on how harmful it can be when families bury the truth. However, this was overshadowed by the over-the-top trope—iness (yes, I’m making that a word) and the story dragging on for too long.

Thanks to NetGalley and Berkley for gifting me the advance copy. I’d still like to give a few of Hendrix’s other books a go sometime.";2023-01-30 17:24:50+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:48.634419+00:00;17;0;en

17869450286630011;"💥 Book Review 💥

Happy Monday friends! I hope everyone has a great start to their week. I'm having some serious Monday blues though 🙃

Realm Breaker by Victoria Aveyard ⭐⭐⭐

So I typed a LONG review and it's not going to fit on here. (Insta, please make the description box longer, kthanks), so my full review is up on my Goodreads if anyone is interested in reading it! (Link is in my bio for my Goodreads profile 🤗)

Long review, kind of short, lol...I wanted to like this book so bad, but this was not it. This book was just okay. Definitely not my favorite of Aveyard's work. The prologue of the book made me have such high hopes. I understand the first few chapters of a new fantasy book, you start off with world building and character development, which is great! But when you go so in-depth that almost the whole book is just that, you lose interest, which I absolutely did.  It would have been cool if the POV's alternated between Corayne and Erida, instead of all the other characters. The characters, in my head from reading the synopsis, were supposed to be these bad-ass characters fighting to stop the end of the world, but they were pretty flat & bland. The ending of the book was not mindblowing in any means. It ended really abruptly. I feel like if the book was written better, the ""end"" of the story could have been in the middle of the book, and we would have gotten to read more. I honestly don't even think I'm going to be picking up the sequel. I'll see how I feel once the book comes out. Considering the flop that the Red Queen series ended on, I feel like Victoria Aveyard was just trying TOO hard with this book

But if you are a person who is able to manipulate your body to a preferred weight range or size and that maintenance requires long-term over-exercising (7 days/week is NOT ideal as our bodies DESERVE and REQUIRE rest days) and under eating (1200 calories is the daily recommendation for toddlers and our brains need that much alone simply to FUNCTION), that is not your body's physiological and genetically preferred weight/size. 

Now, at the end of the day....BODY AUTONOMY. If you believe this regimen is good for you: Do you Boo. But please don't go telling other people to follow suit, because it's NOT healthy or sustainable.

17927809568295325;"✨Reseña: Sucedió un verano✨
¡Hola! Hoy os traigo la reseña de este libro de tessabaileyisanauthor publicado por titania.ed ✨que posiblemente será unpopular opinion 😮‍💨

Creía que se trataría de una comedia romántica divertida, aditiva y entretenida, pero..
No esperaba para nada que me gustase tan poco este libro. Había leído buenas reseñas pero al leerlo, fue un NO rotundo. ❌

Los protagonistas son 0 creíbles, la relación entre ellos es totalmente superficial. Al principio creía que era por estar narrado en tercera persona, pero para nada, imposible empatizar con alguno de estos personajes.
El libro está repleto de situaciones forzadas y surrealistas.
Han habido comportamientos muy cuestionables además de posesivos y situaciones vergonzosas y muy bochornosas.
❌La autora ha escrito en mi opinión, escenas con MUY MAL GUSTO, sobre todo una, que me ha parecido una auténtica falta de respeto a las personas enfermas y a sus familiares.❌

No os puedo recomendar este libro para nada.
Le había puesto un 1,5 ⭐️ pero me estoy planteando ponerle un 1/5⭐️
Para nada leeré la segunda parte.

Catalina Martín desperately needs a date to her sister’s wedding. Especially when her little white lie about her American boyfriend has spiralled out of control.
She only has four weeks to find someone willing to cross the Atlantic for her and aid in her deception. But even then, when Aaron Blackford—her tall, handsome, condescending colleague—who surprisingly offers to step in, she’s not tempted even for a second.
But Catalina is desperate, and as the wedding draws nearer, Aaron looks like her best option. And she begins to realize he might not be as terrible in the real world as he is at the office.

💭🇬🇧
After all the hype about it, I was really looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, I only made it to Chapter 6. 

I liked the plot, the cover, the many recommendations and the short Spanish sentences. 
But I couldn't gain access to the protagonists, who behaved in a totally unrealistic way. I also found some of the dialogue very silly. Catalina is acting more like a 16 year old than an adult. 
The characters would probably fit in a high school setting, but it seems very inappropriate here. 🤔 

I don't understand the hype. But that's just my opinion. 🤷🏻‍♀️

💭🇩🇪
Nachdem es so gehyped wurde habe ich mich wirklich auf dieses Buch gefreut. 
Leider habe ich es nur bis Kapitel 6 geschafft. 

Der Plot, das Cover, die vielen Empfehlungen und die kurzen spanischen Einschübe haben mir gut gefallen. 
Nur konnte ich keinen Zugang zu den Protagonisten aufbauen, die sich total unrealistisch verhalten haben. Auch die Dialoge empfand ich teils sehr albern. Catalina benimmt sich eher wie eine 16-Jährige, nicht wie eine Erwachsene. 
Die Figuren würden vllt in einem Highschool-Setting passen, hier aber wirkt es sehr unpassend. 🤔

Ich kann den Hype um das Buch nicht verstehen. Aber so sind Geschmäcker eben 
🤷🏻‍♀️

Tags: #enemiestolovers #librosdefantasia #personajesgrises #brujas #yafantasy

• Este es el primer libro que leo de la autora y tenía muchísimo hype. Esperaba una historia oscura con inteligencia enreversada de las que me gustan pero aunque ha estado bien, no siento que sea un libro que destaque.

• Durante gran parte del libro la protagonista va dando tumbos sin tener un plan y como tal, no hay un hilo del que tirar. Esto ha hecho que se me haga algo lento pues no es sólo que sea introductorio sino que tampoco te da mucha información como tal de su propio título.

• No obstante, lo que ha dejado ver del mundo me ha gustado y tengo mucha curiosidad por conocer más del reino de los malditos y a éstos, pues han sido los mejores personajes y los que más me han proporcionado. El lore, la ambientación y los personajes grises han sido lo mejor 🔝

• En general he sentido que le faltaba algo de chicha a la historia. Hay algunos giros, pero me han resultado predecibles o un poco random para avanzar con la historia. Alguno si que ha sido guay pero otros eran como muy típicos.

• En personajes, Emilia me ha parecido la típica protagonista YA que no sabe tiene nada especial y va intentando buscar venganza sin saber realmente que hacer. Wrath es el que sí que me ha gustado. Sus gestos y sus pequeños momentos me han dado vida porque aquí sí que hay detallitos que me han gustado mucho y al ser un personaje gris es que le da otra vida.

• Y el resto de malvados también me han gustado, especialmente Lust que es *el malvado* para mí. Es una pena que sus apariciones son un visto y no visto, pero me hace pensar que la historia en el segundo libro se puede volver muy interesante y tengo ganas de ver qué depara.

• Un libro muy introductorio, algo lento en el que no he podido ver el hype que le sacan. Tiene algunas cosas curiosas pero en general le ha faltado chicha y que se profundice más. Estaré pendiente al segundo.

I actually prefer V4’s hair over nose of the others because it just feels more real I guess, bc if someone actually had hair that long and split it in half, that’s about how thick the twintails would be. It also annoyed me when NT was revealed that people were saying like “Miku finally has her hair back” because, just no those twintails are way too thick and heavy to exist (oof I say this as if Miku isn’t literally a fictional character but it just bothers me I’m sorry lol)

17996715880558632;"Ciao gente, oggi vi parlo della mia più grande unpopular opinion

Non è infatti un segreto che per me Caraval sia stata una cocente delusione su tutti i fronti. Andiamo con ordine:

📌La trama non mi ha lasciato niente. Mi è sembrata una storia raccontata senza un fine, con un finale che per quanto possa non essermi immaginata, non mi ha nemmeno lasciata piacevolmente sorpresa. 

📌I personaggi. Piatti, prevedibili, idioti. Scelte discutibili, azioni compiute senza alcun senso. Storia d'amore basata sul niente. 

📌La scrittura penso che sia il più grande problema. Descrizioni poco coinvolgenti, un grosso senso di confusione, uno sviluppo troppo frettoloso. 

📌 Inoltre avrei preferito che venissero mantenuti i nomi originali, per evitare di partorire soprannomi indecenti e confusionari come Tella e Sella

Personalmente, amo quei libri in grado di sfruttare la componente fantastica e immaginaria per trattare tematiche più alte, in cui il lettore possa ritrovarsi o sviluppare una sensibilità verso l'argomento e in cui ci sia un'evoluzione costruttiva dei personaggi. E questo in Caraval poteva essere realizzato molto bene, invece è stato fatto con scarsi risultati: ha potenziale, ma non si applica. 

E la cosa mi dispiace parecchio, anche perché in fiducia avevo comprato tutta la trilogia (cosa che non faccio mai!), avendo sentito solo pareri super positivi. 
Di sicuro le alte aspettative hanno contribuito a peggiorare il mio giudizio. 

Forse è lo stile della Garber a non fare per me, o forse avrei dovuto leggere questa storia da più piccola. 
In sintesi: bella l'idea, ma per me è no.

18021035839494490;"Review: Where Mayflies Live Forever

Fantastic is one word that could pin as the best adjective for this debut novel by Anupama Mohan. It was unputdownable from the start to the end, the search for finding who Veni was, knowing the ways people took to know who she was and ultimately uncovering the truth about her. This was one such book that bugged me, frustrated me, infuriated me, made me sad, and also tried to lift me out of the impending gloom that surrounded Veni's story. Throughout the story, the writing and the style was so ingenious, with the Tamil words that were not just words but emotions instilled at the right places. Being from the same state, I can understand the emotion behind a child calling her granny “atha” rather than just a granny.
The writing unveiling the southernmost part of Tamil Nadu, the scenic and surreal descriptions of places that Veni goes , the caves, especially the underground ones, temples, and houses built in the old styles are so vivid. She also included several simple poems in her narration which was so relatable and calming.

The quagmire of pain and suffering went through because of sexual violence reminds us of how women are treated in a so called progressive society. The trauma that the family suffers, exploring the painful vehemence of the subjects around the “victim” (don’t even know why I am using this word, but the book is written in such a way that Veni or her relatives does not consider her a victim) is critical to how the story is taken forward. Like peeling an onion, you understand the layers of who veni was from the surviving members. The transformation of Veni from an enchanting personality to an avenging goddess, discovering how she lost her voice and gained it all together is so commendable. This is a well-penned story of grief, loss, and the gray areas of justice and humanity that has to be brought to light. I highly recommend you read this book.

Please be wary of triggers such as rape, and gruesome inhuman acts by heinous rapists before you 
pick this one.

By: Eli Blake
⭐️⭐️⭐️

Olivia, oblivious to her werewolf origin, found herself attracted to this new boy in college. While her heart screams to be with him, her morals screamed otherwise. Stuck with a human boyfriend, the future Luna keeps longing for the young Alpha… who wants nothing more than to claim her as his mate. 

I’ll be honest. 🫣 I have zero idea where to start with this book. I love fantasy werewolf/vampire type books but this book was just not it. 🫣 the writing style was really hard for me to follow and to keep up with. The actual story line was good tho, but the writing and the drawn out story kept me from absolutely loving it.

I DNF-ed the heck out of this book. You know…the super popular one that was everyone’s favorite last year? It was not for me. Unsavory characters who spent a lifetime making unsavory choices and wanted to amend for that with…more unsavory choices? I guess this book was a lesson in hurt people hurt people…then they get hurt and hurt more people? I don’t really know. I felt I was fair and made it about 100 pages in. The part where there in their son’s house in then some people break in? I felt if that action-packed chapter couldn’t hold my interest or attention, it was time to DNF.

I will be honest. I don’t know if I could’ve done this without the love and support of my best friend kateyslostchill. It can be hard to DNF especially when it’s so popular or it’s a pick for your IRL book club. If a book is making reading unenjoyable, put it down. It’s okay. Maybe not everyone has a KATEY in their life, so if you don’t let me be the one to help you give yourself permission to DNF a book. It’s okay to DNF a book you aren’t in the mood for.

17976038647428373;"📚Ciao lettori!
❄️Questa sera vi proponiamo un post pericolosissimo: opinioni letterarie… impopolari! - o per usare l’ormai consolidato prestito inglese (sigh!) unpopular opinions. Quei pensieri inconfessabili in materia di libri che forse appartengono però a ognuno di noi. 

❄️Oggi doppio pericolo, perché mi concentrerò sui Classici:

💫Fino all’anno scorso la mia “opinione” era impopolarissima e rimane molto pericoloso confessarla qui: pensavo che le storie con eroine classiche come Jane Eyre, Elisabeth Bennet e per estensione tutte le opere brontiane, austeniane e simili presentassero solo i cari vecchi buoni sentimenti e, se avevo sì iniziato questi romanzi, li avevo anche mollati dopo poche pagine, annoiata e sempre più incaponita in quella che per me era un’incrollabile realtà.

💫Finché, convinta dalle sapienti motivazioni di amica e zia non li ho davvero letti e me ne sono innamorata, capendo che la convinzione in cui mi crogiolavo non era altro che un pre-giudizio, un’opinione espressa senza conoscere davvero quel di cui si parla.

❄️In questa nuova ottica ho recentemente cercato di dare una seconda possibilità anche a Cime tempestose, che è il vero romanzo divisivo di questa pagina e ho capito una cosa: dopo cinque minuti di lettura mi mette di cattivo umore, MA ciò non toglie che sia un capolavoro del Romanticismo, anche se in chiave distruttiva. Il fatto che personalmente non trovi una connessione con i personaggi principali non diminuisce il suo valore di Classico.

🌩️Per non aprire il capitolo gialli: sarà che ne ho letti tanti, ma non conto più quei titoli blasonati che mi hanno lasciato tiepida o infuriata.

⚡Se apprezzate l’idea delle #unpopularopinion per generi letterari, ci farebbe piacere riproporvela in chiave fantasy partendo da Harry Potter (no, non diremo che non ci piace Harry Potter, personalmente non potrei mai.) Fateci sapere se vi va nei commenti.

❓La domanda questa sera sorge spontanea: qual è la vostra unpopular opinion letteraria? 

📌Non abbiate paura: come avete potuto leggere anche io ho dei grandi scheletri letterari!

17886606746631287;"✨Netgalley Review✨ 

The Younger Wife by Sally Hepworth
Release Date: Tomorrow (4/5/22)

I know Sally Hepworth is a popular author, so this will likely be an unpopular opinion.

The Younger Wife is a thriller that focuses on an older man marrying a younger woman, much to the chagrin of his daughters. The book starts with an accident on the wedding day and then reflects back to the year leading up the wedding, as the reader tries to piece together what happened and how things got there.

What I liked about this read:
- It was a quick read. I think I finished it in under 6 hours
- It kept me guessing 
- For the most part, I liked the characters 

What I didn't love:
- This really felt like more of a domestic drama than a thriller 
- I found it to be problematic. There are a fair number of trigger warnings for this book, which I'll put in a comment. The traumas felt more like plot devices than real, sensitively handled character experiences 
- This book relied heavy on the stereotype of ""crazy"" or ""neurotic"" females. It's 2022, why is that still a trope.
- The ending 🤷🏻‍♀️

Sadly, this book wasn't for me. But I am just one review in a sea of them, largely positive, so I do recommend checking out reviews beyond just mine.

Q: What was your first job?
A: Mine was a waitress. I was not good...

Thank you to the publisher, the author, and #netgalley for allowing me to read a digital copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I know I’m in the minority here, but this one was missing the humor and steam of the first one and that made it just an okay read for me.

17899618589305251;"""Tra le cose strane che aveva scoperto di se stesso, era che sembravano esistere tanti Ferguson, che lui non era una sola persona ma un insieme di identità contradditorie, e ogni volta che era con una persona diversa era diverso anche lui"". 

4321 di Paul Auster einaudieditore 

A volte per spiegare certe cose non basta una vita intera, in questo libro Paul Auster prova a spiegarle in ben quattro.
L'autore ha tessuto una ragnatela narrativa stupefacente, creando quattro vite alternative della stessa persona, Archie Ferguson. 
Seguiamo il protagonista dalla sua nascita fino all'età adulta, in quattro versioni differenti di sè e percorrendo più di un ventennio di storia americana. 

Ci ho riflettutto moltissimo, e alla fine ho dovuto ammettere che questo libro non mi è entrato nel cuore. 

""Che cosa sarebbe successo se al posto di questa decisione ne avessimo presa un'altra?"" questa era la premessa con cui ho iniziato questo libro.
Ma quando ho davvero visto Archie prendere una decisione? Personalmente ho sempre avuto l'impressione che fossero gli eventi, oppure gli altri a scegliere per lui. 

Amo tantissimo i libri descrittivi, pieni di eventi e a volte anche prolissi (io stessa credo di essere una persona prolissa), ma questo libro per me è stato davvero troppo. 
Frasi troppo lunghe (ho contato periodi di ben due pagine), dettagli troppo noiosi (le infinite pagine sul baseball che alla fine volevo solo saltare), approfondimenti non necessari. 
A volte avuto la sensazione che non succedesse niente di davvero importante e ci sono stati dei capitoli che mi hanno annoiata. 

Ho apprezzato tantissimo l'idea alla base e le pagine dedicate alla storia americana che sono state le parti che ho preferito.
Dopo 951 pagine però mi sarei aspettata di affezionarmi al protagonista, ma purtroppo non solo non è successo, ma quando ho finalmente girato l'ultima pagina ho provato solo un senso di liberazione. 

Ho condiviso questa lettura con la mia socia profumodilibriedifiori e questo mi ha dato modo di confrontarmi e soprattutto di non mollare la lettura.

17901921860685751;"A question that gets asked a lot is 'why work with a designer to create my stationery when I can potentially do it myself...?' & #unpopularopinion, I kind of agree with the sentiment. Because even though it's my bread and butter, I understand that not everyone has the time, budget or desire to prioritise their stationery over say... an extra day on your #honeymoon.

But we designers do have our place and I guarantee, once you start working with us, you'll breathe a sigh of relief because we literally take care of everything (and also provide a healthy dose of reassurance along the way!). 

We also have our perks such as designing custom elements (such as the venue map above which I did for a recent client), unlimited revisions & a fresh set of eyes on wording, spelling and grammar, advice on colours, trends and concepts. 

& if I can give a tip to consider, don't always go with the first designer you see. Shop around, chat to a few, scope out pricing and find 'your' person; that designer who understands your concepts, gets your timelines and is willing to work with you as opposed to seeing you as just $$$. I guarantee you, we do exist (in spades and there are so many wonderful designers out there) and you'll feel happier knowing your working with someone likeminded than someone who doesn't.

🤍 Heartstopper (vol.1) 🤍

🤍 Charlie i Nick poznają się w szkole. Charlie był prześladowany, ale teraz mówi o swojej orientacji. Nick gra w szkolnej drużynie rugby i słyszał trochę o Charliem, choć z nim nie rozmawiał. Nick i Charlie trafiają na wspólne zajęcia. Szybko stają się przyjaciółmi. Charlie zakochuje się w Nicku. Mają wspólne pasje. Przyjaciele Charliego nie rozumieją, co widzi w Nicku. Nick też nie rozumie, co się z nim dzieje (może kurde jesteś bi?;)) , ale czuje, że przy Charliem może być nareszcie sobą. Podczas urodzinowej imprezy kolegi Nicka, następuje przełom w ich relacji.

🤍 Recenzja (unpopular opinion) 🤍

🤍 Opis musiałam trochę edytować, bo był zbyt monotonny i długi, ale postanowiłam, że i tak go wstawię, żeby przynajmniej było ładnie, bo ja w tej recenzji będę tylko narzekać 😂. Jak ja się męczyłam z tym komiksem! Gdyby nie czytało się go tak szybko, odłożyłabym go chyba od razu, beznadziejny był po prostu 😭. Z drugiej strony, nie mogę powiedzieć, że się jakoś zawiodłam, bo w sumie spodziewałam się, że będzie on dosyć średni i przesłodzony, co wcześniej słyszałam od wielu osób (najwidoczniej u were right maja_szarecka 😂). Charlie jest strasznym pick me boyem, Nick wydaje się tępy, nie mam zdania co do siostry Charliego. Czy będę oglądała serial? Pewnie nie, bo raczej niczego lepszego się nie będę spodziewać :( Czy będę czytała kolejną część? Boże broń 😂 Czy mogę wam polecić tą książkę? Absolutnie nie. Ale czy wam zabronię? Nie, jak chcecie sami się przekonajcie i wyróbcie swoje zdanie, kto wie może wam się spodoba?

🤍 Jako, że mam respekt do autorki za wkład w ilustracje, to o pół gwiazdki w górę poszła ocenka 😂

What more reason could there be to revolutionise consumption than a #climateemergency?! 🚨Yet is it realistic to hope #BlackFriday could ever be more than a giant con?🤔

BUT…how do we shop for ourselves and the planet on a tight budget?! As a first time buyer, navigating this chapter without being tempted by “sales” is a Challenge. I feel guilty every time I spend. Anyone else?

Endless avenues to explore in this messy discussion, but my latest torrent for MetroOpinion explores how #BlackFriday must re-adjust its terrifying grip to GUIDE shoppers & lead a green era of consumption…🌍

Title: Out of Love
Author: Hazel Hayes
My Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️💫/5

SWIPE FOR SYNOPSIS ➡️

February buddy read with bookedwith_al 🤍

Okay, I 100% bought and read this because thebookish.mama raves about it. While I do love her recommendations and will continue to use them, this book didn’t do for me - and that’s OKAY! #unpopularopinion 

I was expecting this to be an easy 5⭐️, but I didn’t enjoy the writing style. The backwards timeline made the ending very blah. 😪 Because I knew “the ending” for the characters from the very beginning, it made some the characters very unlikable. The friendship between the main character and her best friend was the best part of the whole book. 

Even though this was a miss for me, I would not discourage anyone from reading it if you were thinking about it, but please check TW before diving in!

Seven Days in June 
by Tia Williams

⭐⭐💫

So, I seem to be in the minority here, but I really struggled with this book.

There were lots of things that I absolutely loved about it. First, the fact that the main character Eva struggled with a chronic invisible illness. As a person that suffers from an invisible illness, this is the first book I've read that highlights the issue and I thought it was so well done. I very much appreciated it. 

I really liked the characters of Eva and Shane and the discussions about their mental health issues, and the struggles with their past. 

I also enjoyed reading about Eva's family history in Louisiana -- although I wish there would have been more of a focus placed on that part of the story.

The thing that made it hard for me to enjoy was all of the pop-culture references, the focus on what people are wearing -- all things that are not my cup of tea. This ultimately affected my enjoyment of the book but I was trying so hard to see past it due to all the positive points mentioned above. But unfortunately, it just didn't work for me. I was bummed.

Ultimately, I was really disappointed as this one was so high on my TBR list and I like the story and premise. 

🙋‍♀️ Have you read this book? What did you think about it?

18208867996157674;"✨Book Review✨
⠀
It feels like we are finally welcoming summer here in Virginia! I spent most of the day cleaning off our deck and getting our outdoor furniture set up and now we are enjoying some time outside! 🙌🏻
⠀
My Summer Darlings is a juicy domestic thriller with drama and tension thicker than the oppressive Texas heat. I was immediately drawn to the story and it sounded like it would be the perfect guilty-pleasure read for summer, but I have an #unpopularopinion because unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations.😕
⠀
At first, I enjoyed the alternating POVs of friends Jen, Kittie, and Cynthia while learning about the secrets of their seemingly perfect lives, but instead of keeping my attention it quickly lost my interest when the story started to center around the handsome and rich new man in the neighborhood. I love juicy drama between misbehaving moms as much as the next gal, but in this case it all felt very dumb and I found myself rolling my eyes so many times. In the last 25% there was a crazy twist and the ending was thrilling, but it just didn’t make up for the first 75%.
⠀
While this was my first May Cobb book and definitely a case of not the right book for me, I would try her other books in the future. With all that being said, it could be a great read on the beach or by the pool for you.
⠀
Read if you like:
📖Eastern Texas setting
💰Rich moms behaving badly
🤫Female friendships with secrets
🫣LOTS of drama
🙅🏻‍♀️Unlikeable characters

17952957814665578;"💀BOOK REVIEW💀 Crescent City 2 will be the last Sarah J. Maas book I ever read.

SYNOPSIS: After saving the world, Bryce and Hunt just want to lay low, party all night and watch sunball all day. Yeah, like that was gonna happen.

There’s a lot of problems with this book but for brevity I’ll just focus on three.

1.) THE PLOT - Where is it? This is an 800 page book and the only thing resembling a plot turns out to be a wild goose chase. Instead of crafting an interesting story, SJM prefers to have characters hang out in either Bryce’s or Ruhn’s apartments, talking about how great Bryce is.

2.) BRYCE AND HUNT - They’re boring AF in this book. Hunt spends 90% of the books with his head shoved so far up Bryce’s ass worshiping her that it becomes his only personality trait. Actually, you can describe every male character that way. They are all obsessively in love with Bryce. She’s so perfect and kEwL that I can only assume this is how SJM views herself. She’s essentially crafted a fantasy world where everyone loves her and her husband can never leave her.

3.) MISSED OPPORTUNITIES - Bryce’s thong underwear was more of a character in this book than Aidas or Jesiba. Like really? I know there’s a much better story involving those characters and the human rebellion but instead SJM chose to have her main characters spend 90% of the book being selfish assholes. Sorry, ALPHAholes. Ugh, why?

I’m not sure if there was a change in the quality of SJM’s writing with her last four books or if I just grew out of enjoying them. Regardless, I am tucking and rolling off the SJM train. Have safe travels without me, friends.✌️ 

RATING: ⭐️/5

🌿 ¡Buenos días, lectores! ¿Cómo están el día de hoy? Espero que estén bien, que hayan desayunado rico y que empiecen bien la mañana. Por mi parte, traigo una reseña que seguramente dará que hablar. ¿Qué puedo decir? Me sentí completamente decepcionada por este libro. Y a riesgo de parecer una hater del hype, voy a escribir una reseña detallada de todo lo que me molestó, para que no digan que exagero o que simplemente me gusta quejarme injustificadamente de las cosas que otros disfrutan (cosa que suelen decirme a menudo, y que me agota) Si deslizan hacia la izquierda van a encontrar tooooooodo mi descargo.

💥 Tengan cuidado si no leyeron el libro, porque pueden spoilearse algo en la reseña; aunque intenté mantenerla lo más neutral posible, se me puede haber escapado algo sin querer.

📍 Punto especial para odiar a 𝐋𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐞. Qué ser despreciable, por favor. Sinceramente hacía ya mucho tiempo que un personaje no me causaba tanta repulsión. 

📚 Como siempre digo, las reseñas son SUBJETIVAS. Invito a que cada uno lo lea y saque sus propias conclusiones al respecto. No fue mi taza de té, pero sé que hay mucha gente que ama esta saga y lo respeto; simplemente prefiero otra clase de libros/personajes.

🌿 En fin, sin mucho más que decir, me despido mandando mucho amor y paciencia a las fans de Holly Black, pidiéndoles encarecidamente que no vengan a matarme 😅 Les juro que no siempre odio los libros de moda (?)

💬 QOTD: ¿Lo leyeron? ¿Les gustó?

Respondo comentarios en breve.
Espero que tengan un hermoso día.
Abrazo enorme ♡

The way I feel about this book is the way Michael Scott feels about Toby:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
“Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be.""
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I began this journey as a buddy read with michhillblondheim and, like Michele, I had seen this listed on a number of “best romance” lists. LIES.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This epic family saga follows the Cleary family and their lives in the Australian outback in the early twentieth century. The love story in question is the forbidden love between a ‘ridiculously good looking’ priest and the family’s only daughter. Yeah, he initially becomes fascinated by her when she’s 10, and their “love” feels extremely suspect to me, but I don’t know how it shakes out because I straight up DNF at 43%.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I do think people who like epic historical dramas/Kristen Hannah fans might be interested in checking it out. The writing is solid and reminded me a lot of The Four Winds, which won a bunch of awards last year.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I, however, wanted to punt it for all the trials/tribulations it put its characters through. This book is a BULLY, and I was not here for its bullying tactics. I’m talking Game of Thrones-level character elimination. 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
ME: I mean, can we agree to get rid of this book?
THE UNIVERSE: Not without cause.
ME: I have cause. It’s be-cause I hate it.

Q: Do you DNF books? What was your last DNF?

Unpopular opinion alert 🚨

This was just okay and if the ending hadn’t been so heartwarming and endearing it would of been a 2 star for me.

A charming and unique plot concept with lacklustre characters.

This book could be so great, I loved the paranormal components, the ghostwriting persona, the family that owns a funeral home, there are a lot of great ideas in this book but the execution completely lost me.

Our heroine is going home after a decade of being away because her dad has suddenly passed away, yet, nobody seems very sad?! Your father suddenly dies I need the grief to be palpable. Strike one.

The main characters were flat, lots of repetition of inner monologues from the FMC, lots of description repeaters, too much whining all around. Strike 2.

The funeral home owning family was set up to be a quirky and fun counterpoint and it was boring. Just too many missed opportunities for me. Strike 3.

But dang did that ending hit me good, and if the rest of the book would of allowed for all that sweet sweet softness and backbone of our main characters this could of been a really phenomenal read. 

But hey that’s me, everyone else loved it 🤷🏻‍♀️

‘What I mean is you may have had your wars, I’m sure there are scars on your beaches, but that’s all in the past. Our beaches are still waiting for the end of a war that’s been going on for so long people have stopped believing it’s real. They build hotels, put up neon signs, but it’s all fake, we’re on a knife-edge, it could all give way any moment. We’re living in limbo. In a winter that never ends.’

Winter in Sokcho is narrated by a young woman, staffing a guest house in Sokcho, on the border of North Korea, in the off season. She is drawn in by one of the guests, a French graphic novel writer, and is torn between his view of Sokcho and the reality that she lives.

For me Elisa Shua Dusapin’s writing is reminiscent of Otessa Moshfegh. She created a bleak and self destructive protagonist within a brooding and cloying atmosphere. There was such a strong sense of hopelessness and isolation. I have to say that I generally find these books don’t resonate with me and I struggle to engage with the writing. I can appreciate Dusapin’s skill but I don’t think this one was for me.";2023-01-21 19:08:53+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:54.432363+00:00;3;67;en

jak można zepsuć coś, co tak trzymało w napięciu?

[Uwaga: nie czytajcie dalej, jeśli macie ją w planach i chcecie do niej podejść, nic o niej nie wiedząc]

Tam powinno być jakieś ostrzeżenie, że nie jest to do końca zwykły thriller, chociaż przez 70% książki wszystko na to wskazuje. Dlatego jest dziwniej, gdy wjeżdża nagle TAKIE fantasy. Przyznaję zaskoczenie jest, byłam w szoku, ale historia od tego momentu stała się nudna i absurdalna.

Wyszło z tego bardzo specyficzne połączenie, bo jej 3/4 nie zapowiada w ogóle tej zmiany gatunku. 
To trochę tak jakby wziąć Dziewczynę z pociągu, poprowadzić całą fabułę, by na końcu dać wyjaśnienie, że ktoś zniknął, bo porwało go UFO.

Ja tego nie kupuję. Ale mimo wszystko oceniam ją wyżej niż poprzednią książkę, która też była s-f, bo główna bohaterka nie miała mózgu.

Tu czytelnicy są bardzo podzieleni i na ten podział wpływa głównie ten jeden zwrot akcji.
Niestety totalnie nie dla mnie... bo ani to było straszne, ani ciekawe, zaśmiałam się głośno i tyle. 

Autor musiał pić z główną bohatarką, bo na trzeźwo nikt by nie wymyślił 😅😅

Magnolia Parks 🛍️ 

🛍️ Unpopular opinion: I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK. 

🛍️ The constant back & forth, the toxic behavior, I just couldn’t stomach…it was getting old and played out by page 200; the book could’ve been shorter if it was going to lack a real plot. Magnolia is annoying & quite frankly she needs to seek help & so does Beej 😭 

🛍️ Yes, the drama is good - but after awhile it gets old; there’s so much opportunity for better choices to be made & the author wanted me to just throw my kindle across the room every 5 mins! 🤬

Maybe, I’m just not in the head space to love something like this because I can’t relate to it 🤷🏽‍♀️ 

Will I read Daisy Haites? Sure. When? Idk. I’m not pressed 😩😂

17977554406472546;"Shoutout to netgalley for hooking it up with the advanced listener’s copy of this book! 

I try not to be a book badger on the gram but also this book is insanely popular right now and I don’t think I’ve ever seen a bad review for it. Also Reese’s book club literally was touting this book as for “true crime aficionados”, which is so insanely misleading, I CANNOT EVEN!! 

This book vaguely touches on the true life event of how Agatha Christie went missing. Which is not a crime. It’s all told from the perspective of the mistress, and is all just an outlandish theory as to why Nan O’Dea stole Agatha’s husband. Eventually some things venture into criminal matters but definitely not true. So true crime aficionados, do NOT listen to Reese. This book is not for you. (My friend leavemetomybooks recommends Unmasked by Paul Holes if you are looking for true crime.) 

Reese’s false claims aside, this book was insanely confusing. The narration often slides into other people’s perspective but this is just Nan filling in the blanks with her assumptions (which she even flat out addresses in the beginning.) I was intrigued as to how things were playing out…I think there was a good story somewhere in there, but it was all so jarring and convoluted (I think to cover up plot holes). I also was just left with a bad taste in my mouth that it felt like it used the intrigue of Agatha’s real disappearance to bait everyone into a story that didn’t have much to do with that at all. I think I would’ve like Nan’s story a lot more if it hadn’t dragged Agatha into it. (Even with keeping the husband stealing and all that.)

Anyway…that’s my unpopular opinion of the day. I have a few more that I’m considering if I want to share or not. (I DNF-ed basically everyone’s favorite book of 2021.) 

Tell me your biggest book unpopular opinion!! And it doesn’t have to be specific book related. My other one is I absolutely loathe bookshelves organized by color. What a lawless land. 🤣🤣🤣";2022-02-03 15:15:33+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:54.440792+00:00;37;391;en
17969709689095080;"Geen idee wie deze reminder nodig heeft maar hier komtie:

➡️ Respect krijg je niet door je continue aan iedereen aan te passen, altijd aardig te zijn of anderen te pleasen door hun behoeftes boven die van jezelf te zetten. ⬅️

Het voelt misschien veilig omdat je zo conflicten vermijd of alsof je het mensen verschuldigd bent. Misschien ben je bang om verlaten te worden, alleen achter te blijven en is dit jou manier om een gevoel van bevestiging te vinden. Maar ik kan je vertellen: het is allemaal schijn. 

Dit klinkt heel hard en dat is het ook. Als je op deze manier met anderen omgaat, zullen ze slechts jouw houding heel prettig vinden en vroeg of laat zal er langzaam aan misbruik van gemaakt worden. Pas als jij je als persoon laat zien en opkomt voor wat jij belangrijk vind, zul je zien dat de mensen die je waarderen, dat echt doen om wie je bent. 

Waarschijnlijk gaan sommige mensen inderdaad minder naar je vragen of zal je zelfs helemaal niks meer van horen. Deze mensen vinden je misschien opeens toch niet meer zo leuk of hebben geen zin om weerstand te krijgen. En dan weet je eigenlijk al dat ze alleen jouw makkelijke houding hebben gewaardeert en niet je persoonlijkheid. Dit doet pijn, ik ken het. Maar mijn ervaring is dat de mensen die bij je blijven en willen investeren in jou, dat doen omdat ze  je oprecht een tof persoon vinden. Want hoe oprechter jij bent naar anderen, hoe meer je erop kan vertrouwen dat de ander oprecht naar jou is. In geval van haat én van liefde.

Let me start by saying, I adored One Day in December. It was such an instant fave for me and ever since then I’ve gone into Silver’s books with high expectations…only to find myself underwhelmed and disappointed.

I loved the concept of this one and the banter initially was fun. I was ready for a forced proximity romance. But unfortunately it stopped feeling believable or enjoyable for me. Some things were minor issues like sometimes the way Mack (the American character) thought sounded more British or the character description in the book didn’t match the cover. But some things were bigger issues, like when Cleo glossed over her sexual relationship in school with her English teacher and said it was “not as terribly predatory as it sounds.” That was a big red flag for me and after that I found myself getting more and more disenchanted with the book.

If this one wasn’t for a buddy read, I probably would have DNFed (and likely should have anyway).

""Gdzie śpiewają raki"" to jedna z książek, którą polecało mi mnóstwo osób, a ilość pozytywnych recenzji mówi sama za siebie. Kiedy szum wokół tej powieści nieco opadł, postanowiłam po nią sięgnąć, a w zasadzie przesłuchać na Legimi. 
🦀
Cóż, totalnie rozumiem, co tak bardzo zachwyciło innych. Rozumiem, szanuję, aczkolwiek nie podzielam zachwytu. Doceniam walory tej historii. Na pewno daje ona do myślenia w kwestii zachowań ludzkich i tego, jak łatwo jest oceniać oraz skreślać tych, którzy nie potrafią zawalczyć o siebie. Natomiast nie urzekły mnie ani bogate opisy przyrody (za tym nigdy nie przepadałam), ani ktokolwiek z przedstawionych bohaterów, ani sama opowieść, która w moim odczuciu nie wyróżnia się na tle podobnych, a z pewnością nie zapadnie w mojej pamięci na dłuższej. 
🦀
Nie pierwszy (i na pewno nie ostatni raz) znajduję się w wąskim kręgu osób o odmiennym zdaniu, ale zdążyłam się już do tego przyzwyczaić. Nie żałuję, że poznałam tę historię, jednak żałuję, iż zamiast mnie oczarować - rozczarowała.

Book 75 of 2022 was this CoHo sequel that I was on the fence about going into it. After reading it, I’m still on the fence. I just don’t think this author is for me. I’ve read 4 books by her this year and they all left me feeling meh. Having said that there are a few things I enjoyed in this book. Lily and Atlas’s relationship felt very real in this book compared to IEWU. I loved the continuity of the letters. It was super sweet to see Atlas write dear Lily letters. I also found the changing of perspective made me like both characters so much better. Especially Atlas. However all the other characters felt like one dimensional plot devices especially Emmy. The plot was paced well until the second half of the book when everything felt like it was happening at lightning speed. It was frustrating because it felt rushed and a waste of all the character development in the first half of the book. Things with Ryle felt so one dimensional when they had been so multi-faceted previously. The ending was weak. It felt like the book just sort of ended. Despite all that, I think I liked it a bit better than It Ends With Us. But I’m still not sold on Co Ho. Sorry guys! I tried! I really tried! 

3.5🌟/5🌟

QOTD: How many chances do you give an author before deciding they aren’t for you?
AOTD: I usually will try 3 books. This time it was 4 because of how much everyone has said they loved her.

17934016625392845;"Some of these songs are so hard to listen to because either their production quality is extremely outdated and choppy, like “Circle You, Circle You”, or they’re flat out just static screeching (talking to you “Fear Garden” and “Crushed Mary”). The lore of these songs don’t help as it doesn’t change the fact that some of these songs are actual crap or just lacking (Secrets of Wysteria). There are some creepy songs that do have great production quality and have listenable music, but in the case of full on horror songs, I think only “I’m sorry, I’m sorry” has managed to be good, even then it could be considered creepy because it’s purpose of creation is somewhat about awareness for the themes mentioned in the song, and to be more of a tragic narrative than a song that scares you. There is a clear gap of what’s creepy and horror due to creepy songs being songs mostly containing a tragedy, and horror trying to spook you, and most horror just doesn’t do that.

Agree or Disagree? Write down in the comments

Admin thoughts: I find it interesting that every time when ppl talk about horror songs they only mention super old works. What about newer ones like Galleria, Selfish Princess or 1AM for example?

17910932176898386;From #hersheleostropoler Y’all know what a fan I am of metaphors and this one smashed it out of the park! I saw this in response to a dude’s claim that being neurodivergent removed a degree of accountability for his inability to read women’s body language and non verbal cues, and therefore, him making babes feel uncomfortable was not entirely his fault. Im devoting my life to trying to make the world safer for ALL of our children and stuff like this, I believe, should be the goal posts for contemporary etiquette. The stringent etiquette that boomers still advocate for is simply not viable or realistic in a multicultural, contemporary society. I truly believe we need to develop a type of international default culture, that we all adhere to regardless of our differences. I love that we have normalised talking about things like mental health, and bringing people living with disabilities and neuro divergence out of the shadows, but unpopular opinion 420, being neuro divergent or suffering from mental health is not a free pass to removing your accountability. You simply just have to find new ways to navigate the world. Exactly the same way you have to navigate all aspects of society, when you know right from wrong and you still cannot differentiate it with your behaviour, stay home until you figure it out. It’s simply not fair to make other people feel uncomfortable for any reason. And if you go around wearing your excuses as a badge of honour, then it’s basically intentional 🤷🏼‍♀️ #sorrynotsorry #neurodivergent #neurotypical #noexcuses #accountability #feminism #feminist #sexualharrassment #metoo #autism #spectrum #adhd #add #intersectional #intersectionalfeminism #equality #equity #boomers #ettiquette #society #sociologist #culture #multicultural #multiculture #unpopularopinion #noexcuses #noexcusesmate #toxic #toxicbehavior #toxicmasculinity;2021-08-31 03:29:30+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:56.384468+00:00;8;972;en

i don’t want to dump on this book too much, but honestly i thought it was just fine? i read it pretty quickly because i really wanted to know miles’ backstory, but besides that mystery, it was a very average read.

i have a hard time with the characters because i know everything works out well and they’re both supposed to be damaged and imperfect, however… i do think miles treated tate horribly at times and she had very little self respect because she kept taking him back no matter what. reading her narration was really frustrating and actually, this was difficult for me to read as it was quite toxic! that’s just a me thing, some people enjoy these kinds of stories, but maybe because i’ve been surrounded by toxic relationships my whole life i don’t really want to go through that again when i read books, even if the characters do grow and get better by the end 🥲

one thing i found really interesting was colleen hoover’s writing, as i think it has improved a lot since this book. her recent novels are much better written - i love seeing author growth!

thank you to prosebefore for organising a buddy read for this, i loved hearing everyone’s opinions 🥰 

ugly love gets 3 ⭐️ from me!

Quite the opposite, actually. 

❌ Men are not a biological necessity, they don’t keep your lungs pumping, nor your heart beating. 

❌ Men are not a societal necessity, in fact, they’ve been quite the cancer to modern and ancient civilization.

❌ Men are not a mental necessity, they cannot give you the self love you seek, the confidence you covet, nor the peace of mind you preach. 

✅ What you NEED is a self that doesn’t feel incomplete when alone. 

✅ What you NEED is a self that feels internally assured. 

✅ And what you NEED is an identity that doesn’t revolve around someone else’s attachment to you. 

Go get that, sis! I believe in you 😘

Pierwsza część drugiego tomu Rodziny Monet za mną. Na półce czeka część druga. Czy chce po nią sięgnąć?
Niekoniecznie...

Hailie dorasta, zacieśnia więzi z braćmi i poznaje kolejnych członków swojej rodziny. Akcja toczy się odrobinę szybciej niż w pierwszym tomie, a mimo to znudzona brnę przez bardzo długie opisy, które niewiele wnoszą do fabuły...

Powtórzę się - język autorki jak i sam pomysł na historię robią wrażenie! Niestety toksyczność braci Monet, ich stosunek do siostry i zasady, których każą jej przestrzegać bardzo mnie uwierają.

Hailie nie może ubierać się jak chce, nie może rozmawiać z żadnymi chłopcami, jest narażona na ciągle niebezpieczeństwo, a do tego musi się mierzyć z chamskimi zachowaniami większości braci.

Brakuje mi emocji. Tęsknoty za zmarłą tragicznie mamą, lęku przed tym, czym zajmują się jej najbliżsi. Zamiast tego otrzymałam surową akceptację karygodnych czynów pięciu braci Monet.

Przykro mi. Naprawdę mi przykro, ale nie potrafię polubić tej serii. Przeczytam druga część drugiego tomu, bo jest to współpraca barterowa, ale naprawdę ciężko mi się za niego zabrać...

18348933673034386;"UNPOPULAR OPINION: HUSTLE IS HEALTHY 

There’s not one single person who I look up to that didn’t bust their ass to achieve what they’ve achieved. 😮

Hard work is essential, and thinking that you shouldn’t “have” to work for
anything is weak-minded. This cotton candy concept that hustle is toxic, and you shouldn’t work for anything is messed up in my opinion.

👉Losing fat requires above average effort. 
👉Building muscle requires above average effort.
👉Building a scalable business requires above average effort. 
👉Maintaining healthy and rewarding relationships requires above average effort.

Give above average effort → experience the payoff down the line → confidence and fulfilment.

If you agree, it would mean a lot if you shared with someone in your life and left a like and comment below.

However, it pisses me off when people use “they’re just voice banks bro chill” to defend sexual art that is completely unrelated to actual use of a vocal synth software. Even if something is only mildly sexual (Racing Miku 2022 for example) it still gets on my last nerve that people defend it with this stupid excuse.

I thought I would adore Love and Other Words but I ended up giving it 2⭐ for reasons I cannot discuss because they are spoilers. Just know that I had some serious issues with the last 15%!

I vlogged my experience and will be posting that video on Tuesday, so look out for that if you want to know more.

I used to be that person who always pleases others. I would always be asked “what happened to you?”. I used to always be caught off guard and feel obliged to explain my situation to a complete stranger especially as I use walking aids to help me manage. 

That trauma of that injury that led to crps keeps circling that vicious cycle & every time someone asks the cycle repeats itself. I mean why do others think they have a right to ask..? That 5-10 seconds of a conversation will be forgotten by them later on that day, but it remains vividly for us for the next week or two until another stranger would ask. 

It’s come to the point where I’ve realised I do not owe an explanation to anyone and if I feel that they need to know then I just say a knee injury. I do not need to keep repeating the trauma over and over and over again. You do not need to share your trauma… of course unless if you would like to!

I guess the summary of this is I do not owe an explanation to someone about my life changing crps condition.

🚨 UNPOPULAR OPINION AHEAD🚨

This one just didn't do it for me. I had seen it so highly recommended on Bookstagram and highly rated on Goodreads; when my library hold on this book came through, I was super excited. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met. 

I think the author did a great job with creating this plot and the overall mystery. I just believe the way it was executed didn't work. It was a slow burn mystery (emphasis on the SLOW.) I contemplated quitting this book multiple times. By the time it started to pick up, I was 89% done with the book.

Additionally, the characters in this book were very flat. There was hardly any character development and I found myself bored with them. The main character, Helen, was especially unbearable. I found her character to be extremely unbelievable, especially given half of the scenarios she found herself in.

Unrelated to my rating, but I also guessed two of the main twists early on in the book! I thought it was so obvious from only about 25% in what a few characters were up to. 🙁

I'm glad that so many readers enjoyed this book, but it just wasn't for me, personally. I am willing to read more of this author's works in the future, though! I believe she has a lot of potential.

🎧📚Thank You For Listening- Julia Whelan
Genre: Fiction
➡️ for synopsis
🌶: little to none
⭐️: 3/5

I think some of you are going to be real mad at me over this …

Unfortunately this was a “meh” for me.

I tried to listen to this and DNF’d twice.  Finally the 3rd time I forced myself to really focus and get through it. Once I did that I didn’t hate it … but it just fell incredibly flat for me. I was bored with a lot of this story. 

I really didn’t buy into the love story.  It wasn’t bad, I just didn’t feel the passion that I wanted from them. It seemed way more forced than it should be.

I also felt like the author tried to include SO much that in the end it didn’t work well.  I would prefer to see her focus on a trope or two, a story line or two, etc.  There was so much going on I didn’t feel truly invested in any of the plot lines.  The grandma storyline was actually my favorite. (Although her name being Blah Blah was mildly annoying, but whatever I can get over that.  I know people have nicknames for family, but this nickname felt really disrespectful.)

Will I recommend this particular story? No
Will I continue to read and listen to Julia Whelan? Absolutely!

This one has a LOT of positive and 5 star reviews though so if it sounds good I say give it a shot! It may be a win for you! 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️

Hola #readers! 

Rieccoci con zia Jenny! Finalmente il penultimo della serie!! Oggi #unpopularopinion, preparatevi 😅

🦋 e finalmente siamo al penultimo libro della Covenant Series! 🎉 
Onde evitare spoiler direi di partire subito con delle riflessioni 

🪲🪲 qui troviamo una Alex che, sebbene all’inizio diventi tipo super saian, poi sembra tornare in se e, non si sa con quale arcano miracolo, metta sale in zucca diventando, paradossalmente, la più responsabile e calma del gruppo 🧐
Personalmente non mi è piaciuto il libro e anzi mi ha quasi mandata in blocco.. una storia che, al posto di 524 pagine ne poteva durare 200 in meno.. sembra che zia Jenny dovesse allungare il tutto.. 

🔥 Punti di Forza

📍lo stile incalzante di zia Jenny è sempre al top e anche qui non si smentisce
📍una totale rivalutazione di alcuni personaggi che ora, finalmente, hanno una luce migliore
📍alla buon ora cresce anche la protagonista, che evolve da ragazzina ribelle a donna un po’ più consapevole 

🥶 Punti deboli 

📍ripetitività: viene ribadito il punto centrale, il legame tra i due Apollyon: zia Jenny è il quarto libro, l’abbiamo capita!
📍situazioni dilatate: per uno stile incalzante come quello della Armentrout, ci dovrebbe essere più azione, invece questo libro non ne ha molta
📍finale scontato!!!! Cioè no, non ve lo spoilero tranquilli, ma lo si capisce dalle prime pagine..

Tropes: grumpy x sunshine 

I had really high expectations for this book and while I really enjoyed it, the main character was not cohesive enough for me. It almost felt like one person wrote most of the pages and then for the romance part someone else wrote. I thought mixing the true crime fascination was a fun twist and combined two things I really enjoy, while also displaying a realistic product of overindulging in true crime. Yes it can be fun! But protect ya peace!
A few spicy scenes, but doesn’t take over the whole book. 
Overall, I would recommend this to a true crime fan in search of something a little spicy.

Se viene una señora UNPOPULAR OPINION. 
Lo siento (sobretodo por mí) pero no me ha gustado nada🙈

Por un lado, la narración. Me ha recordado mucho a Aristóteles y Dante (que tampoco me gustó), con saltos temporales vagos, descriptiva en detalles y a veces muy de película, muy ficticia.
Por otro, la trama. Como fantasía, bastante floja, nada que no se haya visto antes. Lenta, básica y predecible, pero mucho😅

Y los personajes, me han caído fatal, con su toxicidad, sus cosas absurdas..
Quería pegarles, gritarles: ""¡Niño, espabila!""🤦🏻‍♀️
Entiendo que al principio son más jóvenes, pero si 5 años más tarde siguen haciendo las mismas cosas..uf🙄 
He intentado empatizar, de verdad, pero pasé de odiarles a que me dieran absolutamente igual, es más hubiera matado a la mayoría para darle chicha a la trama😂
Y el romance, ¿PUEDE HABER COSA MÁS OBVIA (y repetitiva🙄)? Será bonito, sí, pero a mí no me ha parecido nada especial, al revés, muy cansino. Siempre era lo mismo😅

Hay evolución, sí.
Reconozco que de cara al final se me hizo más ameno (las últimas 150 de 700) y hay dos personajes que me han gustado.
Pero, para mí, no ha sido suficiente😅

En fin, esto sólo es mi opinión.
Yo no he conectado nada con la historia, pero si queréis leerlo, hacedlo. Además, si vais con pocas expectativas siempre es mejor🤭

Mała dziewczynka wychowująca się sama na bagnach, ucząca się czytać i pisać w wieku… nie wiem, dziesięciu czy tam dwunastu lat od starszego kolegi, nie dość, że szybko to jeszcze z zamiłowaniem do literatury i nauki. Aha. I potem jeszcze pisała wiersze. Dziecko w pozycji Kyi nie tylko miałoby problemy z relacjami społecznymi, ale i intelektualnymi. (Możecie mi podrzucić jakieś teksty naukowe, jeśli się mylę). 

Wątek kryminalny był całkiem ok. Stanowił klamrę między przeszłością a przyszłością. Tyle tylko, że właściwie skumulował się głównie do formy procesu, którego celem było pokazanie, że… ludzie w mieście mieli rację co do Kyi. Podejrzewali ją o najgorsze i to właśnie zrobiła - z zimną krwią i z wyrachowaniem zaplanowała zabójstwo. Przekonała wszystkich o swojej niewinności i żyła sobie szczęśliwym życiem. Tak jakby - not cool. I rozumiem, że można chcieć śmierci kogoś, kto usiłował nas zgwałcić. Ale życzyć komuś śmierci a zabić to jednak dwa moralnie różne zagadnienia. 

Pomijam już, że nastolatka z bagien, brudna i w ciuchach z darów była i tak wystarczająco piękna (długie nogi, gęste włosy, pełne usta), żeby kusić swoim wyglądem. A sam trójkąt miłosny był dość tendencyjny. 

Dochodzą jeszcze kontrowersje związane z autorką i zamieszanych w morderstwo jej mężem i synem. 

Także no. Wychwalana przez wszystkich (przepraszam - przez większość) książka nie trafiła do mojego serduszka. Nie trafiła nawet obok. Przypominam - Kya zabiła młodego mężczyznę, bo założyła, że ponownie będzie chciał ją skrzywdzić. A wiecie co mogła zrobić? Wyjechać. Z tą górą hajsu, którą miała za wydanie książek. Mieć szczęśliwe życie i czyste sumienie. 

Aż mam ochotę na reread „Zbrodni i kary”.

Agree or Disagree? Write down in the comments

Admin thoughts: Disagree, TheSoul Publishing just wants to capitalize virtual singing but tries to hide it. In Polar's introduction video they said she's inspired by Abba and acted like it was a new thing despite vocal synths and VTubers did so for years or even decades. They stole the concept without giving credit just like Polar's songs are stolen music from Ava Max and Ariana Grande there's enough proof online. Vocaloid fans have their right to be pissed

It Ends with Us
By Colleen Hoover

Ok, so I finally did it, I finally read a CoHo book.  But y’all, I just can’t with this book. (SPOILER ALERT)

Disclaimer: I found this book to be a bit triggering and I’m not one who ever gets “triggered” by books. 

There were parts that were very raw and real and I respect what the author was trying to do by showing how easy it is to find yourself in an abusive relationship and how hard it is to leave, but reading this book was hard for other reasons.

The moment we met Ryle, he was bad news.  There are so many red flags!  He was rough and manipulative from the second they met.  And how creepy that he just starts feeling her up and saying “how far would you go” when they met 5 minutes ago.  I would have slapped his hand and ran away, not fallen for the guy. 🤦🏻‍♀️. If you were trying to endear me to him, it didn’t work.  I had a bad taste in my mouth about him the whole time making it predictable.  It’s also hard to read a book where you hate one of the main characters from the beginning.

I guess I get why people loved it, but no thanks, not for me. 

I really just wanted less about Ryle and more about Atlas 🤷🏻‍♀️. I wanted more of adult Atlas’s story.

I really appreciate the author’s note at the end.  DV is terrifying and so complex and everyone has a different story, so I’m glad she spoke to that. 

And for all you nurses… of course he was a neurosurgeon, am I right? 😂. And scrubs are not hot, they’re gross and baggy and covered in germs and body fluids and only 5% of people look good in them.

17925075155046139;"💥 Book Review 💥

Happy Thursday friends! It's almost the weekend & I can't wait to spend some time in the city ^_^

Kingdom of the Cursed by Kerri Maniscalco ⭐⭐⭐

Synopsis:
Emilia will do anything to avenge her sister, Vittoria's death. As she sells her soul, she travels to the Seven Circles where she is introduced to a seductive world and participates in things she only thought of in her wildest dreams. While continuing her life in the Seven Circles, she learns one lesson, trust no one. She is tested in every way possible, and it leads to many clues and answers to her sister's death.

My thoughts:
Ya'll, I almost DNF'd this book. It did not have the same spark the first book had. The first 300 pages of this book were so damn boring. The small relationship between Wrath & Emilia in book one is FULL BLOWN in this book that it takes away from the whole plot of the story. Nothing made sense. I felt like my mind was reeling after every page, and I kept having to go back to re-read some things. She kept mentioning her sister, and how she was going to find out what happened to her, but then it immediately went right back to Emilia and Wrath doing something. After page 300, and the whole way this book was redeemed, in my opinion, WAS THAT REVEAL! If you know, you know. It's where the story gets interesting, and I almost threw my kindle across the room because I was so damn excited. I couldn't put the book down after that. Am I super excited to read the final book of this series? Hell yeah! Remember, this is my own opinion! You might read it and absolutely love it! & I sure hope you do!";2022-01-06 15:23:41+00:00;2023-03-27 14:37:58.344483+00:00;6;458;en

18179146387163442;"📌 ทำไมเราถึงไม่อยากให้ยึดติดกับ ""Introvert-Extrovert"" #UnpopularOpinion (?)

หลายครั้งที่ช่วงนี้เราจะเห็นคอนเทนต์ของ Introvert มากขึ้น แล้วก็มีอันที่ไปแซะทาง Extrovert บ้าง บางทีก็เป็นสีสันดีนะ แต่ต้นเรื่องของบทความนี้ ที่ทำให้เราต้องมาทำรูปและบรรเลงบทความขึ้นตอนห้าทุ่มคือ ""การตัดสิน"" ประมาณว่า คน Introvert ก็ต้องเงียบ ชอบสันโดษสิ หรือคน extrovert ก็ต้องดี๊ด๊าเวลาไปข้างนอกดิ แล้วชุดความคิดพวกนี้มันทำให้ลามไปเป็นปัญหาการแซะกันของคนสองพวกนี้ เพราะยังติดอยู่กับ preferences ของตัวเองมากเกินไป

เราอยากทุกคนกำหนด In กับ Ex ว่าเป็น ""ความพอใจ"" หรือ Preference ก่อน มันเป็นแค่ความชื่นชอบของคนประเภทนั้น ที่ไม่ใช่ว่า Introvert จะอยู่กับผู้อื่นไม่ได้ หรือ Extrovert จะไม่อยากอยู่คนเดียว เรื่องแบบนี้มันเป็นเหมือน ""ความชอบ"" ขณะนั้นมากกว่า และมัน ""สามารถเปลี่ยนแปลงได้"" ซึ่งจะมีเรื่องของตัวแปรสังคมแวดล้อม และสภาวะจิตใจขณะนั้นมาเกี่ยวด้วย (บวกกับระยะเวลา) เช่น คุณเป็น Ex ที่ตอนนั้นต้องเรียนออนไลน์เป็นระยะเวลาหนึ่ง แล้วคุณดันค้นพบว่ามันสงบดีนะ ต่อจากนั้นคุณก็อาจ ""ชอบ"" อยู่คนเดียวมากกว่าก็ได้เหมือนกันเมื่อเวลาผ่านไป แม้จะยากและนานหน่อย แต่ก็ไม่ใช่ว่าเปลี่ยนไม่ได้

“เราเป็น introvert ที่ทำตัวดีดๆ ก็ไม่ผิดอะไรหรอก”

อีกข้อหนึ่ง เมื่อเรายึดว่าตัวเองคือคน Type ใดๆ เราจะมองว่าตนเองจะต้องปฏิบัติตัวให้เหมือนคน Type นั้น เช่น ถ้าเราประกาศตัวว่าเป็น Introvert เราก็ควรจะเงียบ เรามีโอกาสจะ fulfilling ตัวเองได้จากการที่มี ""ป้าย"" แปะที่เสื้อตัวเองว่าคุณน่ะคือคนแบบนั้นจริงๆ คล้ายว่าเราดูเป็นนักบอลมากขึ้นจากการใส่เสื้อบอล แต่ก็จะไม่ได้บอกให้ไม่ต้องไปสนใจเลยว่าตัวเองจะเป็นอะไร การทำความเข้าใจตัวเองนั้นเป็นเรื่องปกติของมนุษย์ และเราสามารถเรียนรู้ตัวเองได้เพิ่มขึ้นจากการได้ลองทำอะไรใหม่ๆ เสมอ

ฉะนั้น เราไม่ได้จะให้ทุกคนลองเอา ""ป้าย"" ที่ติดอยู่ออก
แต่แค่อย่าให้ ""ป้าย"" นั้น มาตีกรอบว่าคุณต้องเป็นคนแบบเดียว

""โลกนี้มีอะไรอีกเยอะแยะให้ออกไปค้นหา
อย่าให้อะไรมาตีกรอบเราเลย""

Che rapporto avete con i libri presi in prestito in biblioteca?
Io ho dei bellissimi ricordi della piccolissima biblioteca che frequentavo da bambina, di cui ho letto tutta la serie bianca de Il battello a vapore ma poi, crescendo, non ho più utilizzato molto questo servizio, se non durante il periodo dell’Università.
In questi mesi, grazie al piccolo cuoricino che batte dentro di me, ho salutato i bimbi al nido e ho abbracciato i libri presenti nella biblioteca che vedete in foto. Inutile che vi dica quanta fatica io stia facendo a non prenderne in prestito a sacche ogni giorno 😂 Non riuscirei a leggerli tutti, ovviamente, ma l’istinto da accumulatrice cerca comunque di farsi strada.
Da quando lavoro qui non ho comprato nessun libro: riesco a leggere quello che voglio (anche le novità, perché questa è una gran bella biblioteca) senza per forza dover comprare tutti i libri che vorrei! In particolare sto facendo una scorpacciata di graphic novel e non potrei che esserne più felice 💓

Cari, a me è piaciuto! Con alcuni “mmm”, buchi, allungamenti di brodo, personaggi secondari dimenticati, storyline che potevano essere interessanti ma che sono state rese completamente inutili, domande rimaste senza risposta ma… forse mi aspettavo il peggio del peggio e così non è  stato! Mi sa che per una volta le aspettative mi hanno un po’ aiutata 😅

Noora Vallinkosken Koneen pelko jäi selvästi oman lukumukavuusalueeni ulkopuolelle, mutta jostain syystä jäin sitä kuitenkin lukemaan ja päätin lopulta lukea loppuun asti. Kirjalla on varmasti ansionsa ja osa lyhyistä luvuista oli omasta mielestänikin hienosti kirjoitettuja. Myös teoksen teemat, lähiöelämä, luokkaerot, väkivalta ja päihteet ovat tärkeitä aiheita. Mutta tämä ei vaan ollut minun kirjani. Romaanin monet kuvaukset olivat inhorealistisia tai menivät ankeudessaan ja outoudessaan jo niin yli, etteivät tarjonneet oikein edes kosketuspintaa. Toiset kohtaukset jäivät puolestaan häiritsemään ja liikaakin mieleen, mikä varmasti on ollut tarkoituskin.

17967383624252182;"✨ Health is the NEW Wealth! 🌱💰

Ladies, let's talk about the hustle and girlboss culture. It's time to face the truth: constantly pushing ourselves to the limit is NOT sustainable for long-lasting business success. 🚫

We've been sold the idea that working 24/7 is the only path to success, but at what cost? Our health, happiness, and well-being are suffering. It's time to embrace a different approach. 🙌

Here's the thing: your most valuable asset isn't your business – it's YOU. So, taking care of your physical, mental, and emotional health should be your top priority. 🌟

Here are some tips for building a successful business without sacrificing your well-being:

1️⃣ Set boundaries: Know when to step away from work and dedicate time to self-care and loved ones. 🏡

2️⃣ Prioritize sleep: Sleep is essential for optimal health and productivity. Aim for 7-9 hours every night. 🛌

3️⃣ Nurture your body: Fuel yourself with nourishing food, stay hydrated and exercise regularly. Treat your body like the temple it is! 🥗💧🏃‍♀️

4️⃣ Cultivate mindfulness: Practice meditation, deep breathing, or journaling to find clarity, balance, and inner peace. 🧘‍♀️📝

5️⃣ Build a supportive community: Connect with like-minded women who share your values and understand the importance of a healthy work-life balance. 👭

Remember, health is the TRUE wealth. When you prioritize your well-being, you'll be amazed at the success that follows. 💖

Let's ditch the hustle and girlboss culture and create a new movement that promotes sustainable, balanced, and healthy success. Are you with me? 🌈

17924286302423822;"Interpretations about happiness, depressions, and all are completely valid for the song, but really it's not as deep. Ondine is a water nymph that acquires a human soul by marrying a human, but if the said human is unfaithful or any sort, they'll die. Ondine, the play written by Jean Giraudoux, is about Ondine who fell in love with a knight-errant, Hans, who was already betrothed to princess Bertha. Hans and Ondine were to marry but Bertha met Hans and manipulated him with guilt. There was already animosity between Ondine and Bertha; Hans deceived Ondine about Bertha and Ondine decieved Hans about being an ondine. But eventually Ondine was executed and Hans was to die. In the song, ""The knight who jilted Ondine... he died!"" referenced the play. And no one lives happily as a matter of fact.  TL;DR, The song is about [men] being happy (or faithful) to appease ondines or die, and a lot of references to the play.

Admin thoughts: To be honest I mostly grew up with literature from my country and don't know too many drama plays that aren't super huge classics like Hamlet for example. So I haven't heared of Ondine before😅

“Happiness isn’t some permanent thing we’re all trying to achieve in life, it’s merely a thing that shows up every now and then, sometimes in tiny doses that are just substantial enough to keep us going.” 

There’s a reason I continue to read most of what Coho puts out into the world. Her writing just does something to you. It hits you so deep you don’t even realize it. While I stand by saying that I didn’t totally love this book, the writing is so exquisite that I have to send out a standing O. 

“Pulling away from his kiss felt a little like trying to put out a forest fire with a nuclear bomb.” 

I’m not gonna go into a long review because everyone is reading this book right now and you’ll see a million more posts about it. But I’ll say these few things - I think you can call pretty much right away how the story is going to play out and end. I spent the majority of the book mad at Ledger and Diem’s grandparents. I think things could have been handled differently if everyone would’ve had the teeniest bit of maturity.  I did enjoy reading this. It reads incredibly fast and again is written so damn well that you could just devour it in half a day. It just wasn’t a fave for me.";2022-01-31 17:28:33+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:01.103417+00:00;5;1063;en

1. Secret Garden
I started this drama with high expectations because of the its writer Kim Eun Suk. As I loved dramas like TKEM and The Heirs written by her. And secondly because of Hyun Bin. But this show utterly disappointed me. So what happens is that bodies of both leads are switched.😒 People think its funny. NO ITS NOT. Atleast not for me. Also,  both main leads and second leads were so annoying😒
.
2.  My Love From the Stars
Frist of all I didn't like Jun Ji Hyun's character. And I also didn't enjoy the story

3. Mr. Queen
Wahi fazool Secret Garden jesa plot. Kuch aur nhi bcha dunya mein likhny ko?

4. Doom At Your Service
Ye dono bas Love me, Love me khel rhy thay is mein. I only watched 8 episodes of this one. The love triangle seemed interesting lekin mein ghalat thi.

5. What's Wrong With Secretary Kim
All of the characters were trying so hard to be cute.😒Especially the second lead couple. Over actors. Mera chapair lgany ko dil krta tha second FL ko. Among all the rom com dramas I have watched till date only True Beauty and Touch Your Heart made it to my favourites. 
.
6.Hwarang
The reason I watched it:- Taehyung. 
The reason I was disappointed:- He didn't have many scenes. And Han Sung (his character) was killed at the end😒. I also like Park Hyung Sik aur usko lrki ni thi milni. Tou faida.
So, I watched it till 8 or 9 episodes phir bas.
But I love the OST

Well I've actually just finished this one yesterday and unfortunately it is an unpopular opinion. I started this one last year when it first came out and decided to DNF early on as I could not connect with it. When I spotted it on the lovely Amrit's anovelpage shelf I suggested a buddy read as I was yet to read a bad review so I thought I should try again.

This time round I got further than the first time but by the end of the first section I remembered why I stopped before but I knew Amrit was reading the same thing so was eager to hear how she got on. When we had our first chat I was relieved to hear my fellow buddy reader had struggled the same as me! The opening and the synopsis sounded right up both our streets but we just could not connect with the writing style. I am so glad I decided to buddy read with Amrit for two reasons. Firstly without her I would have DNFd this again and secondly she felt the exact same as me so we are both in the unpopular opinion club. I did finish this book this time round but I'm not going to review it as I really don't know what to say. I have been left speechless but not in a good way, maybe we both read a different book from everyone else?!? Thanks again anovelpage for reading this with me and I'm looking forward to reading one we enjoy more next time. 

I can count on one hand how many times I have returned to a DNFd book but think this has shown I should just trust my first impressions.

Have you read and loved this book or is there anyone out there who would like to join Amrit and I in our unpopular opinion club of two? 

Have you ever DNFd a book and  then returned to it and loved it because I certainly haven't!

I gave in to The Folk In The Air series as a buddy read with my friend tati.lee.libros

I didn't want to read this series as some people say that is similar to ACOTAR and, if you have been following me for a while, you would know that I just cannot deal with that series. It is just not for me AND THAT IS OK! 

Can we stop pushing loving a certain book or series into others? Let's normalise and accept other people's opinions, accept we all not going to love the same books for many different reasons. 

Anyway! Unpopular opinion... 

This first book gave me ACOTAR Book 1 vibes at the beginning. I did enjoy that book 1 and gave up on book two. BUT, in this one I felt there is a lot going on but nothing really happens. The attitude of the characters was annoying for me, this can be due to my age, to be honest. 

In addition, I would never understand why the female lead on these types of books has to get so many love interests, there is nothing ekse in life?? I would have enjoyed this more if she had been a better badass.

Unfortunately, I DNF halfway through and won't be bothering with it in the future, so with that I DNF the entire series.

17932206920187152;"*L'Arminuta di Donatella Di Pietrantonio 
.
Un libro scorrevole dallo stile tagliente e a tratti crudo. Devo dire che non mi ha conquistata. Ci sono troppi elementi che rimangono in sospeso anche dopo il finale, per altro brusco e immediato.
La figura dell'arminuta mi genera quasi antipatia, non mi sento solidale con il suo personaggio nonostante sia consapevole del fatto che si tratti di una vittima degli eventi e delle scelte, poco ponderate e prive di sentimento, di chi le sta attorno. Una famiglia non la vuole più, l'altra non è pronta ad accoglierla con le sue peculiarità e differenze culturali.
Ho amato follemente la figura di Adriana, sua sorella, ragazzina forte già adulta a soli undici anni. Non ha più niente da perdere ma conserva la sua dignità. Testarda, disobbediente, impicciona ma anche devota, dolce, empatica... ha più palle lei dell'intero gruppo di personaggi che muovono le corde dell'opera.
Uno spaccato di vita pesante e veritiera, dove la miseria, economica e sentimentale, fa da padrona.

Most people think that once you hit a certain age, you can't start something a new business. No time, no energy, no bandwidth for new drama in life. But I believe age is just a number and it's never too late to pursue your dreams!

If you're a 40+ Asian woman feeling stuck in a rut, I want you to know that you're not alone. It's okay to let go of a business that isn't working out and start something new. You deserve to have fun, freedom, and financial independence.

Don't let anyone hold you back from earning your own money and pursuing your passions. It's time to break free from societal norms and expectations and start living life on your own terms. You got this!

Do you agree? Why or why not?

17978032744745627;"I feel like the reason why some people say that there isn’t enough fan content out there is probably because the amount of professionalism and detail put in some of today’s MVs and just Vocaloid art in general has kinda taken over the algorithm, and they definitely don’t look like how they used to back then where some song’s original PVs were just amateur artists making or compiling art to associate to their song. There is still amazing fan content out there, but I feel like only the most outstanding actually get seen. I feel like also this has became a new standard where the only way to get noticed is to make a highly detailed illustration to an MV in order for it to be noticed by the algorithm. I miss where MVs were just simple illustration slide shows for fan made covers or something like The daughter of evil where it was literally just a new PV but with fan art being played as a slideshow. There is definitely fan content out there, but the algorithm makes it harder to find.

The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue

It was one of my #mostanticipatedbook and was in tbr since it released. I heard its #audiobook yet it took me 5 days to complete 🥲

What I liked-
❤️ #Luc , the darkness who took the form of the boy which our protagonist adored in her dreams
❤️ #Henry , the human love of the protagonist

What I didn't like-
💔 #Addie , even though she lived for 300 years still acting like a kid 🥲
💔 VERY SLOOOW PACE
💔 Details, which could have been skipped but was present in the book to make the readers realise that #AddieLaRue lived 300+ years. If it was kept short and crisp, I believe it would had ranked in my favourite/satisfactory reads but sadly it didn't.

I never liked Luka, but she is definitely not as good as she used to be. My main source for this is her beta NT for Project Sekai. In Project Sekai, Luka sounds kinda like a worse Meiko. (Which is odd, because Meiko's NT beta is so good!) It doesn't help that they pick terrible songs for her to sing in too. She tends to be too high pitched and choppy. I even think Kaito has become better than her even if he gets too high pitched as well. Kaito never gets as choppy as Luka does. Just for reference Miku, Rin, and Len still sound good to me.

17972300539939555;"After reading ""Verity,"" I was excited to check out this bestseller. 

I am a fan of Colleen Hoover's writing style and ability to weave a powerful story. 

But, ""It Ends With Us"" landed a bit flat for me. 

I found the book started slowly. I anticipated the big reveal from the moment the main love interests met. 

And, I found the ending to be problematic for the people who live the book's realities. 

The story romanticized the main love interest's actions and furthered the societal fairytale of a happy ending that all-too-many times is unrealistic in these situations. 

I couldn't help but bristle given my life experiences and my knowledge of the realities of people who have suffered these kinds of experiences.

Dating can be viewed in two ways:

🤎 It's a means to the end of marrying someone, and you should only date people who have the intention of marrying you.

🤎 It's casual fun and if something doesn't work out, then it's fine, because we're not really dating each other anyway.

The first point is a good one if you want to get married. The second point is valid if you're looking for a fun time with someone who doesn't want anything more serious. 

👉🏽 But there is a third way: dating as an opportunity to get to know each other better and fall in love with each other slowly over time, which can lead to marriage if that's what happens naturally or through hard work on both sides.

It seems like people often make choices based on the first point, which means they don't make good choices—they date shallowly or marry shallowly. And then they regret those choices later on down the line when they realize they should have waited longer before making commitments. 🙃";2022-12-15 15:21:16+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:03.051368+00:00;8;39;en

17938041734481140;"🖋️ Reporting about someone who died under unfortunate circumstances...

A: Why did you publish that person's photos/ why did you reveal that person's details?
B: Because others are also doing it....

When making a decision, it is a common impulse to look and see what others are doing. Nevertheless, how can one say that just because everyone else is following a path, that is the right path?

Do what is right. You may not get a lot of views or hits. But you don't have to follow the crowd when it is clear that they are wrong. 

Images of death tell a certain truth, but it depends on the intention behind their use and the meanings imputed by the viewers. As I believe, the images of death can be used in a way that respects the deceased or contributes to a potentially noble social goal of the journalist conveying that information, rather than sensationalizing the incident or selling the story for hits and views. 

Carry this 👇 thinking with you always. It will help you do the right thing. 

As Lord Buddha said, ""තමා උපමාකොට අනුන් ගැන සිතන්න..""
(අත්තූපනායික ධර්ම පරියාය)

""සබ්බේ තසන්ති දණ්ඩස්ස, සබ්බේ භායන්ති මච්චුනෝ, අත්තානං උපමං කත්වා, නහනෙයිය න ඝාතයේ.

සියලු සත්වයෝ දඬුවමට බිය වෙත්, මරණයට බිය වෙත්, එබැවින් තමා උපමා කොට, අනුන් ඝාතනයෙන්, හිංසනයෙන් වළකින්න.""

As Jesus Christ said:

""Therefore whatever you desire for men to do to you, you shall also do to them.

(Matthew 7:12 - Bible)

'Treat others how you want to be treated.""

An easy litmus test from Poynter: Think of someone you truly hold dear, and imagine them dying (unpleasant, I know). Now imagine that a local TV station/ newspaper publishes a very sensitive story or very sensitive photos of this person without ever talking to you. How do you feel about being excluded from this process to respectfully tell stories, protect the privacy and celebrate the life of your loved one?

I’m not saying like, for example since ppl brought this one up a bit, “black people cant have straight/wavy hair!!!!!”. I’m saying how taking black features and making them white is whitewashing. Also its about fictional characters btw not irl people. 
Also with the “pale =/= white” if you disagree with that i’m not going to care about your opinion 😭??? You are literally saying pale bipoc are white. Like a pale black person or asian person isn’t white because they’re pale LMFAO? White is a race man

PT 2 LOLL more rants 👍 tiktok makes me in such a ranty mood dud 😭

anyways i may have said some of these in my stories but yass! not much to say again <3 srry if some of these aren’t very real takes?? i kinda rushed them, if its like genuinely bad and u give me a reason on why it’s bad i’ll remove it ^^

17954194963708999;"I get so many questions about this from worried women who have regular cycles, but aren't ovulating or bleeding with the full (or new) moon. 

I'm here to tell you... IT'S OKAY! 🤗 🌕

You can still be healthy and fertile and not be synced with the moon cycle.

Here's why: 

Yes, the average menstrual cycle length is 29 days, which is pretty close to a moon cycle (approximately 29.5 days).
 
However, normal cycles can range anywhere between 25 and 35 days. 

And unlike the moon cycle which never changes, our menstrual cycles are influenced by a whole lot of things.
 
This means ovulation is never set in stone and varies from cycle to cycle. And this will affect your overall cycle length.

Happy full moon in Virgo, wherever you are in your cycle! ♍️🩸

THE LOVE HYPOTHESIS by ALI HAZELWOOD
Available now.

⭐️⭐️⭐️

🔬 Goodreads Description:
As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn't believe in lasting romantic relationships--but her best friend does, and that's what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees.

That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor--and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford's reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive's career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding... six-pack abs.

Suddenly their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion. And Olive discovers that the only thing more complicated than a hypothesis on love is putting her own heart under the microscope.

🔬 My Thoughts:
A 3.5 rounded down to a 3 after very intentional discussion and reflection.  Going into this one I knew that there has been criticism of how Title IX was used in the plot and how women in STEM were portrayed in general.  While this is not my favorite rom-com, I did appreciate the conversations from women in STEM who both agreed and disagreed with the plot points and character portrayals. Controversy aside, I think this one confirms that fake dating and miscommunication tropes are not my thing.

QOTD: last hyped book that didn't meet your expectations.

I'll go first! 

Tomorrow x3 by Gabrielle Zevin is one of them for me. I didn't want to read it just yet, because the hype for me most of the time doesn't live up to it... and that is what happened with this one, which was chosen as September pick for wellnessbookclub.

I decided to DNF at 27% mainly because I was bored. I left the book to the side for a few days, and tried to pick it up again but didn't work out. It started quite good, but not mindblowing for me... Definitely, I am not a part of the right audience for this.

And it was very nostalgic for me as I was born in the 80s and grew up in the 90s where I spent so much time playing video games! So I thought I would love it. 

The book is not bad. Is just not for me. Many people are loving it, I am a firm believer that we have to voice our opinion in a respectful manner.

I know some people here don't really respect my opinion much when I DNF a book, never mind when it is a popular one and I decide to share it. Some people feel like they cannot say anything for the same reason. If you have an unpopular opinion about a book everybody loves, just say it.

My thoughts:

I love Emily Henry and everything she writes, but I do have to say this was my least favorite book I read of hers. I’m loved the characters but there was just something with the plot that was not doing it for me. I will say the ending of this book was perfect. I absolutely loved it. But I still love her writing and will always buy her books🥰

If I Had Your Face is the story of four young women in Korea, all of whom are obsessed with physical appearance, especially their faces. They fixate on Asian models and celebrities, and save up from their low-paying jobs to get their jawbones reshaped, have their eyelids lifted, and have rhinoplasty, so the tips of their noses curl up slightly. This is a story about impossibly high beauty standards, secret room salons catering to wealthy men, strict social hierarchies, and K-pop fan mania. 
💄👠
We both had very high hopes for this book, but those there diminished the further we got into the story! It covers a fascinating subject, and we usually devour all stories about the far east, but very sadly not this one. Ingrid very nearly DNF'ed it, and Nerijus struggled with it for about a week. We found the writing to be dull and unimpressive, the characters were very shallow, and we couldn't connect with the girls. 
💄👠
What did not help was a very abrupt ending without a noticeable outcome or morale of the story. We suspect that partially we struggled due to changing narrative, where as soon as you start to know a character, the story switches to another's point of view. 
💄👠
However, indeed, not everything is doom and gloom! It was exciting to learn about South Korea's fixation on beauty and the struggles young women have to go through. Modern Seoul is a mesmerizing city and is on our list of places to visit!
💄👠
Interesting topic, but sadly did not live up to our expectations!

⭐⭐
2 stars out of 5 from both of us.

⁠
Many of us have fallen for the misconception that our overthinking is responsible for our intelligence, our discernment, and our ability to keep it all together!⁠
⁠
Fact is, if you’re over-identified with your anxiety, when the time comes to begin challenging and truly detaching from the habit of anxious rumination, you’ll notice your hesitation to completely commit. We’re driving with one foot on the break!⁠
⁠
What if we lose our edge? Our shrewdness? What if we become irresponsible? What if - when we stop overthinking - we lose our personality?⁠
⁠
My dears, our overthinking isn’t evidence of our intellect, its not the sole source of our ability to “keep it together” and it’s not why those who love us love us.⁠
⁠
Overthinking is merely a muscle that’s become over-used! In the same way that you wouldn’t use a lawnmower for every task around the house, your thinking mind isn’t the appropriate tool for every job! It takes time and courage to train ourselves to utilize the other tools at our disposal.⁠
⁠
Intelligence isn’t just about having the ability to think, often it’s knowing when it’s time to practice detaching from thinking. Simply put, not all the thoughts are credible, helpful, valid, or even useful. ⁠

We Are Not Like Them by Christine Pride and Jo Piazza
Genre: Contemporary Fiction
Pages: 311
Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ (3/5)

I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but I really didn’t like this book.

When I read the synopsis (swipe to read) I was drawn in and immediately picked it up. However I liked the synopsis more than I liked the story, and I felt it wasn’t executed that well.

Don’t get me wrong, there are many points in the story that were incredibly powerful, thought-provoking, and tear-jerking. I just wish there were more of them. Those moments powered the book for me and made me want to keep reading.

However, I didn’t feel connected to either of the main characters. We heard a lot about how strong their friendship was, but I never felt it. I also didn’t see significant character growth from any of the characters (especially Jen).

I had really high hopes for this one and I’m pretty disappointed with it. I struggled to get through it 😔 let me know your thoughts below!";2021-11-14 16:12:14+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:04.983866+00:00;18;305;en

I mean, they’re not terrible (by all means!) but I don’tparticular adore them, like I do the rest of her books. It’s actually one of the reasons why I’m so happy with Bookstagram: You guys told me these series were worth it and you were right! Cause especially after reading ACOTAR and Throne of Glass, I had no idea about what was to come. 

I have to give kudos to House of Earth and Blood though: that one is DEFINITELY the best of the bunch♥️✨

Unpopular Opinion:

Being accustomed to, and therefore accepting of being offered / given less than what you are worthy of… 

Allowing people to ignore your needs + boundaries, or simply not setting any, and therefore finding yourself overwhelmed, overextended and undervalued…

Not holding people to appropriate healthy adult standards…

NOT ONE of these things is synonymous with being a supportive Black woman.

Unfortunately, humans in general tend to become accepting of certain treatment and experiences because they have never been exposed to anything more / better, and may not believe they deserve, or can ask for or have more / better.

Guess what?!

You deserve the same level of care that you offer.

You deserve high quality experiences and connections.

You don’t have to be accepting of things that don’t bring value, peace or reciprocity to your life.

Reframe mindsets and understandings around what it is and isn’t to be supportive vs enabling, and stop the defining of Blackness / supportiveness / care by how much nonsense a person is accepting of.

17978011559074980;"Have you ever thought about how our healthcare system works? Once you do, you’ll never be able to unsee it.⁠
⁠
You see, our healthcare system isn’t even health care – it’s sick care 🤒 And chronic gut symptoms perfectly make my point.⁠
⁠
If you struggle with what I call a hot mess gut, you’ve likely gone to your PCP, gotten a referral to a GI doc, maybe even had a colonoscopy … and been told that nothing is wrong or that you have IBS and to take an over-the-counter med to manage the symptoms.⁠
⁠
The huge red flag 🚩 with this, however, is the blatant blindness that symptoms are signs that something is not right … and symptoms always progress until they are diseases. ONLY THEN will you have something that your physician will be able to treat.⁠
⁠
Does that not feel really backwards to you? 😵‍💫 Instead of healthcare, we have established a system of sick care. I believe we should not wait for symptoms to worsen before doing anything. ⁠

Es que una cosa nada tiene que ver con la otra y por muuuuucho tiempo nos hemos metido en la cabeza y en las “metodologías”  de enseñanza de la danza que parte del compromiso de un bailarín con su danza se mide en lo que arroja la BALANZA 🤷🏽‍♀️

¿Será que dejamos de una vez por todas de relacionar el peso con el valor humano?

Embarcate en el bus de la transformación de la narrativa de la danza y de su evolución, seguro costará al principio educar el ojo 👀 y el corazón ❤️ a no sentir rechazo cuando un bailarín esté por fuera de los estándares que te enseñaron que eran los permitidos, pero te aseguro que valdrá la pena 100% que el compromiso que tendrás de tus bailarines será invaluable y los resultados serán maravillosos 💜

17920934909276347;"💕 OUT OF LOVE - REVIEW 💕

Author: Hazel Hayes
Genre: Romance/Cont. Fic.
Rating: ⭐️⭐️💫 (2.5/5 stars)

SHORT SYNOPSIS:
A couple ends their relationship after 5 years together. The young woman finds herself questioning how this happened and when they fell ""out of love."" She begins going backward in time to recount their relationship, starting from the end.

MY THOUGHTS:
This may be an unpopular opinion?

This book was recommended to me from a friend as part of the 12 books in 12 months everyone was doing at the beginning of January. 

This was Hazel Hayes' debut novel. I do think she has beautiful writing, and I do think I will read more of her work in the future. But overall.. 

It.. unfortunately.. fell flat for me. 

My biggest thing with this one is that I had a REALLY hard time with the reverse order of this book. The chapters are going back in time, rather than forward. Because of this, I found it hard to keep track of the progression of MCs' love story because I kept having to go backwards to try and piece everything together. I just don't think my brain works that way. It also completely threw off the pacing for me, because it felt like the story wasn't really going anywhere, considering the first chapter is really the ""end"" and the last chapter is the ""beginning."" This writing style just wasn't for me. I think I would have LOVED this story, had it been in the typical format of moving forward in time!!! 

I also struggled with the length of the chapters/parts of this book (I say ""parts"" because they are not labeled as chapters). I felt like that made this book feel really long to me (I'm talking like 40-50 page chapters). 

Lastly, I really just didn't connect to either main character. I did not like Theo at all, from the very beginning, and kind of found it frustrating to read about their relationship since I knew from the ""end""/first chapter that I was not a fan of him.

Overall, it just wasn't a memorable one for me. I hate to say that, but again, I want to always share my honest reviews!

AS ALWAYS, I do NOT discourage anyone from trying this one out! I know several people who adored this book, and you might also! 😊

✨Unpopular Opinion✨

I was so so excited to read 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐿𝑎𝑠𝑡 𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑤𝑖𝑓𝑒 by Ashley Winstead, the reviews on goodreads are so hyped up and there’s lots of 5 stars. However, I found this to be super reptitive, boring and to be frank I just didn’t enjoy it. 

I finished this up a few days ago and thought after a few days of processing the story it might grow on me, but unfortunately no. There are tons of triggers in this book, which usually dont bother me but the continuous, over and over extreme dominatrix scenes were just too much. It totally dimmed all the really important concepts that the author was trying to portray. 

The storyline had potential for sure. I enjoy thrillers revolving around cults but this fell flat. I felt there were loose ends regarding Shays relationships with both her soon to be ex-husband and with podcaster Jamie. 

As said before this story holds every trigger possible, so go in prepared. SADLY, one of my main thoughts throughout - I totally could see this actually happening in the real world with all the creepy politicians, especially NY state🤷🏻‍♀️!

SYNOPSIS: “While in college in New York, Shay Evans and her best friends met a captivating man who seduced them with a web of lies about the way the world works, bringing them under his thrall. By senior year, Shay and her friend Laurel were the only ones who managed to escape. Now, eight years later, Shay's built a new life in a tony Texas suburb. But when she hears the horrifying news of Laurel's death—delivered, of all ways, by her favorite true-crime podcast crusader—she begins to suspect that the past she thought she buried is still very much alive, and the predators more dangerous than ever.”

QOTD: did anyone else feel that this was a let down?

NOTE: Out of copyright reasons I can't use the original audio that's why the vocalist version is there instead

When the song was just released (and still) people have mainly focused on Ghost as the creator which in my opinion it's kinda hurtful because there's more people behind that project that worked hard on it only to barely get any recognition. For example, Vane, they're really REALLY talented and is still a small artist on YouTube. Vane worked on that song too and. Really. They did an amazing job. And about Mors, I just love how they drew probably more that 10 frames for the PV, I'm literally amazed by the great job they did. I'm not saying to not give credits to Ghost, but please focus on the other people that worked on it too!

📚 Book Review📚: The Resting Place by Camilla Sten
🌟 rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️/5
📅 Pub Date: March 29, 2022

Let me start by saying I have seen some great reviews of this one, so I am definitely in the minority here but this just didn’t do much for me. I was expecting a dark, creepy atmospheric suspenseful thriller but instead it was a slow burn overly drawn out plot. The character names were similar Vivianne, Vendela, Veronika, Victoria (who also goes by Eleanor to make it extra confusing). There aren’t that many characters in the story, but unfortunately the ones who were there felt bland and underdeveloped. It is still really well written, but the plot and pacing just didn’t work for me. There was a surprise twist that I hadn’t expected but it didn’t have as much of an impact due to the characters involved. 

I had both the audio and physical copy of this, but I had issues with the NetGalley app crashing and distorting the playback and read the majority of this using the physical book. I do think I’m the unpopular opinion on this, so I encourage you to read some of the rave reviews and check this one out if it sounds interesting to you. 

Thanks to macmillan.audio and netgalley for the ALC and minotaur_books for the ARC. The Resting Place will be out on March 29.

The activity of his mouth might be something that draws attention for some people. It’s interesting to me that often riders want horses to keep their mouths closed when working.  They like to fasten the equipment tightly to prevent mouth expressions.  I don’t agree with this, because how can we ask a horse to move freely through his whole body but then restrict the mouth?  I adjust my bridle and bits to encourage mobility of the tongue and jaw.  IMO those delicate structures deserve full range of motion, just like the whole rest of the horse.  Seeing how the horse does in this kind of contact tells us a lot about how they are feeling in the rest of their body.

17946360350605801;"SIGH. This was my first TJR, and I really wanted to like it, but I was kinda disappointed.

She’s more famous for books like The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, Daisy Jones & The Six and Carrie Soto is Back, but it was the plot of One True Loves that caught my attention - Emma marries the love of her life, they live the perfect life and the day before their first wedding anniversary he disappears in a helicopter accident. Skip to 4 years later, she is now about to marry her best friend, who she’s reconnected with after a while, and is very happy etc - at this point the husband returns. How is it all going to turn out? How will she choose which man she wants to be with? 

TJR skims the surface of some very interesting themes - how it is possible to ‘outgrow’ someone (applicable in platonic as well as romantic relationships), even if they were very important to you at one point in your life, the fact that people and their needs and goals can change, and is it really wrong to want different things or different people in your life at various points? Some people choose to hang on to relationships that were once fulfilling even if they aren’t anymore, and in the process don’t even seem to mind if everyone involved is actually miserable, whereas others are willing to accept the reality of changed relationships that are no longer fulfilling and want to call it quits. Do we choose to be with someone because of how much love we feel for them or because we like the person we are when we are with them? 

I felt there was a lot of potential for a more meaningful exploration of these themes, but the book left me feeling like I was at one of those parties where everyone is happy with superficial chit chat and no one’s interested in really getting to know anyone…. but what I wanted from this party  was to make a connection and have a deep conversation! 

I did not love this love story. I think there’s a reason why I don’t read romance novels. I have only ever loved one love story and that was The Bridges of Madison County. 

Ok, peace out! 

PS - Oddly, I think I might enjoy the movie 🤔

Macy and her dad buy a cabin to escape to in the summer and on weekends. Elliott is a boy her age who lives next door. Macy and Elliot quickly become friends as they bond over books and then eventually become each other’s first loves. After a decade since the two have seen or spoken to each other, Macy is in a convenient engagement and is working herself to the bone as a pediatric resident. She is comfortable in her life, keeping her heart safe, until she runs into Elliot again and finds herself opening up, as he could always get her to do, which in turn, also brings up old wounds.
 
The start of this book had all the elements to turn into the perfect romance for me. But somewhere throughout the pages this just didn’t happen for me. I know this is an unpopular opinion but I just didn’t love this one. The theme of this year has been me trying second chance romances to be reminded over & over that they typically don’t do it for me. The beginning of this book was everything I wanted- Two pre-teens holed away in a closet-turned-library reading, having the awkward growing up conversations, the deep life altering conversations and then falling for one another. The chapters in the past were all I needed. The present moved too quickly for me. Elliot was immediately ready to change his whole life for her when he ran into her for three minutes. It just felt overwhelming and not as romantic to me as I assume it was to others. The build up to the end of the book and seeing why they had the falling out they did happened way too quick for me. There was a lot of trauma they both went through and then it felt really glossed over. The beginning of the book was a cozy hug and I wanted to end this one feeling that way but I ended up feeling like there was a lot lacking in the present timeline and a lot still to be hashed out and discussed.

18226042786090929;"Things people don’t tell you about Bali 🌴🛕

Bali is a gorgeous little island in Indonesia, a place full of western tourists who decide to live there and work as digital nomads or even open up their own businesses. The scenery is absolutely to die for, the locals are the friendliest people I’ve met, so willing to help and please you and the weather is just perfect (most of the time). But like anywhere there are pros and cons. 

This post may be an unpopular opinion, however I believe in showing and telling both the best and not so good things about countries. These are just my opinions and as always I respect that others may not feel the same 😊

Here are some things that people don’t tell you about Bali:

🤑- It’s blooming expensive compared to the rest of Asia. Accommodation and food will come at a higher cost here.
🏍️- The traffic is mad, there are no rules on the roads, anything goes. So be aware, if your not a bike rider then Bali probably isn’t the place to learn. If you’re not confident on a bike, you need to get confident.
🚧- With the traffic also comes the badly maintained roads. Be careful.
🦟- There are insects everywhere!
🏝️- The beaches beautiful but some are full of rubbish, this didn’t come as a surprise to me as I had seen pictures, but when you are it in real life it’s quite sad. There are groups that do litter picks which help massively, so get involved if you want. 
💸- The best way to save money on food is to order a take away through Gojek or Grab, it’s much cheaper for food as you don’t have to pay a massive government tax and service charge, which in restaurants can add anything from £5 and up onto your meal cost.
☀️💧- The weather generally is very good in Bali, but if you visit in the rainy season, you need to be prepared for it to rain most days, and not just a little bit of rain, like a lot! We have found it tends to be in the afternoon/early evening. So get out and do things in the morning to avoid disappointment. 

Did any of these things surprise you?

#unpopularopinion 
#3 / 2023

I only picked up this book because of how popular it was on #bookstagram 
I didn’t really try and find out what age group was reading this and was just appalled by the number of posts appreciating this book but this book was just not my cup of tea 
Given, that it’s well written (we love the representation) and fairly quick to read I did think it was extremely teenage-y (target population being 11-14 YO?) and honestly also a bit predictable. Of course I didn’t predict the exact character but the storyline had been used a good few times by TV shows and other books. 
I have a lot to say but I’m not going to trash a book so many people loved. I realised it’s just not a genre I enjoy and should’ve just checked before buying the book.

“Hell is the absence of the people you long for.” 

This is going to be a mini review because I don’t have a lot of nice things to say about it 🤷🏻‍♀️ Mainly because this just wasn’t the book I was expecting. 

What I thought Station Eleven would be : a post-apocalyptic story after the world is hit by a deadly pandemic and insight into how the very few remaining live and treat each other. What Station Eleven actually was : a ton of boring characters I couldn’t tell apart, most of the book was spent in the pre-pandemic life following an actor and his many wives, jumping back and forth between timelines without reason, a comic book thrown in here and there, and MINIMAL exciting looks into a prophet and traveling symphony in the new world. 

I told myself at the beginning of this year that I’d be better about DNFing books - welllll I’m not any better at it 🤦🏻‍♀️ I started this one in print about a month ago, got about 20% through and couldn’t get into it so I set it aside. Last week I switched to audio and by 40% I knew it just wasn’t for me. But I kept going! Why? I couldn’t tell you. 

So I need to know - do you DNF books? Do you have a minimum percentage or page number you get to before giving up? How do you decide which ones to DNF? Does it matter if you’ve purchased the book yourself vs a book you’ve borrowed? Help a girl out 🤷🏻‍♀️";2022-05-31 15:59:09+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:07.035113+00:00;26;605;en

Some will agree with this and some won't and that's ok. Social media outlets like Tik Tok and Instagram have created so many ""Insta hairdressers"". Clients are coming in knowing the verbiage to all the most popular trends in the hair industry. What they don't realize is hair isn't ""one size fits all."" There are so many things to take into consideration when doing color. Current hair color, hair history, texture....the list goes on and on. But Karen on IG went from black to icy blonde in what looked like 1 session so why can't they🤣 

 My point is to not disregard the clients wants and needs. We are women, we are usually attracted to what we can't have...

“A Flicker in the Dark” - Stacy Willingham

🔦 SYNOPSIS: When Chloe Davis was a teenager, 6 girls went missing in her hometown and her father was convicted for their murders. 20 years later, girls start missing again..

🔦 REVIEW: Alright yall, you know I always promise to keep it 💯 on here, so here it goes..

This was one of the worst thrillers I have read all year.

In short, it was slow, boring, disastrously predictable, and unrealistic.

It PAINED me to keep turning the pages in this book. The ONLY reason I kept going was because I had a theory from the VERY beginning about what happened and I needed to prove myself right. And guess what - I did just that, DOWN TO THE LETTER. I DID NOT MISS. If you read thriller books (or even if you don’t) you’ll see this coming a mile away. 

The problem I had was how we got to the big reveal did not even make sense. Logistically, it just did not. There were so many other ways to do it.

I didn’t like how the main character’s addiction was handled, her interaction with law enforcement, or the cheesy way her storyline progressed through the book. It tried so hard to be suspenseful but it simply was not.

It is so easy to scare me, and I can be a fan of the slow burn, but this poor thing bored me to TEARS. 😭😭

ALL OF THAT BEING SAID…

Kudos to anyone who can write a book. I simply could never. The concept overall was good, and this was a debut - I think the author COULD do better in a sophomore novel. However, this one simply was NOT it.

🔦 VERDICT: 1.5 STARS ⭐️✨

🎶 Song Rec: I am not assigning a song to this book.

From the first page of almost every book I’ve read of hers so far, I’ve been immediately sucked in and there’s been a connection for me. However, this one, there wasn’t. (Waits for the unfollows …)

I’m going to make this pretty short & I’m not going to post a synopsis because we’ve all seen this one already. As a mother, this was a really heartbreaking story to read. There were times where I found myself tearing up, but other than that, I didn’t feel too much of a connection. I felt like the relationship between Kenna & Ledger was a little rushed. I wanted more out of the story and the events that happened. Don’t get me wrong, I liked it, but it definitely wasn’t my favorite.

I don’t even know what exactly I want to cover in this review, so I guess I’ll start with the fact that I really wasn’t the biggest fan of the first book, whatever the heck it’s called. I have a really hard time getting into urban fantasy, and apparently even 𝐒𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐡 𝐉. 𝐌𝐚𝐚𝐬 can’t get me past that. Couple this with the fact that I’m kinda annoyed with how needlessly long her books are getting these days, and we have a recipe for disaster.

17932857898992718;"THE PAPER PALACE📚

What was the last hyped book you read?

I was really excited to read this but I’m just not sure how I feel!❤️

SUMMARY🔥
Elle is fifty years old sitting at her family holiday home at the paper palace but everything is different, because last night she slept with her childhood best friend Jonas.

Now across 24 hours we see Elle try to make her biggest decision, her husband Peter or Jonas?

REVIEW📚 
I have a lot to say but I will try to keep it concise!

Firstly I loved the depictions of the paper palace, reminded me a lot of where the crawdads sing and I felt I was really there and living in that environment. I thought the prose was done very well and as a reader we really got an insight into how Elle was feeling.

However there were a few big issues I had. Firstly it is across 24 hours Elle makes her decision but we travel back in time across her entire life and part of her mothers. This i feel was meant to show us how everything has lead Elle to this moment or what could influence her choice. Which NORMALLY I wouldn’t have a problem with.

HOWEVER a lot of it was situated around sexual abuse and sexual trauma. Now sexual abuse in a book doesn’t bother me but it needs to be there for a reason. I couldn’t find it here. I felt it was included for a shock value and didn’t really have a effect on the outcome of the book. 

I unfortunately just couldn’t look past it despite how much I enjoyed seeing Elle’s life through the ages and through Jonas and Peter. I just think sexual assault should never just be there for the sake of it. The author works at HBO and maybe it’s seen as shock value there but it didn’t fly with me. Made the experience uncomfortable.

RATING
Unfortunately despite how well this book was written I just can’t rate it higher than this.

#november9 is the story of Fallon and Ben, who meet on 11-9 when they are 18 and agree to meet on the same day for the next 5 years. With no communication in the year between meetings, they share the hours together they can. But as they actually get to know each other, is this a relationship that can last?

The plot idea was interesting to me, but I didn’t like how so many big bombshells got dropped every year with no context or good explanations. The twist about the fire and how all was explained away really didn’t sit well with me. I didn’t believe the relationship because there was no time between the days - it all seemed too easy and fake to me. I didn’t love it 🙃Overall, a fine quick read, but not a favorite.

17905265909358586;"📘 • 𝘈 𝘍𝘭𝘪𝘤𝘬𝘦𝘳 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘋𝘢𝘳𝘬 by Stacy Willingham

For a full review, see my website. It was too long to fit all of it here. 

💭 • 𝘈 𝘍𝘭𝘪𝘤𝘬𝘦𝘳 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘋𝘢𝘳𝘬 is an eloquently written debut novel that follows a protagonist as teenage girls disappear in similar to the manner in which her father kidnapped and killed teenage girls 20 years before.

𝘈 𝘍𝘭𝘪𝘤𝘬𝘦𝘳 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘋𝘢𝘳𝘬 is very well written. The prose is strong and descriptive without being overdone, although there were quite a few nonsensical metaphors. While I enjoyed reading the words and could easily picture the story, I found the book to be slow and slogged through it. It took me way longer than it normally does to read a book, because I would put it down and not feel motivated to pick it up again.

Another big problem with 𝘈 𝘍𝘭𝘪𝘤𝘬𝘦𝘳 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘋𝘢𝘳𝘬 was its predictability. While Willingham threw red herring after red herring at the reader, it was apparent from the beginning who the murderer was. I questioned my theory a few times during the novel; however, it was apparent how the mystery would play out. If you do not read many mysteries or thrillers, perhaps you will not find it as predictable as I did. I pushed through the book rather than not finishing it simply to see if I was correct.

There were two other issues that bothered me. The first being the protagonist and her portrayal. I am so tired of thrillers relying on protagonists having a mental illness or substance use issue(s). Authors seem to think that this is the only way to create unreliable narrators. I would also argue that most often authors are misrepresenting those with mental illness.

How many teenage girls have diamond earrings and sapphire rings? Is this a Southern thing? Should I be upset that I only had “costume” jewelry at that age? This book weirdly included this. 

I do not want it to sound like this book does not have any redeeming qualities or that it is a horrible book. Overall, I found 𝘈 𝘍𝘭𝘪𝘤𝘬𝘦𝘳 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘋𝘢𝘳𝘬 to be fine. If you do not mind a slow burn mystery that is not very original but is well written, give this book a try.

17983700131880413;"Unpopular opinion… MEN
Om man ska gå efter betygen på Goodreads.
Jag gillade Det börjar med oss, mer än Det slutar med oss. 

Här kommer alltså recension av båda böckerna, på en och samma gång. As my feelings! 

Det var så många delar av Det slutar med oss som var så frustrerande att läsa. Ok att Lilly inte bara accepterar att bli behandlad som skit, men det är flera tillfällen (speciellt i början) som bara förbises som normalt och upphetsande, som jag tycker är helt sjuka. Exempelvis när the dude letar igenom alla lägenheter i huset för att hitta henne för att han bara MÅSTE ha sex med henne. Han tjatar och tjatar, tillslut säger hon ”åh okej dåååå, ska bara duscha så att jag är fräsch för dig”. 🤮 

Bortsätt från de, måste jag ändå säga att Hoover är bra på att fånga in läsaren i berättelsen. Jag var i berättelsen direkt. Båda böckerna. 

Jag tänker att jag inte måste beskriva handlingen av dessa böcker utan kan säga såhär: kille som är dum i huvudet, triangeldrama, och ung kärlek. 

Jag gillade Det börjar med oss mer för att där får vi även följa Atlas, och det är mindre obehagliga stunder. Den var såklart mer förutsägbar än Det slutar med oss, men det gör verkligen ingenting för mig. Jag vill bara att det ska gå bra för alla involverade (förutom Ryle, I don’t give a f*ck). 

Jag var otroligt tveksam inför att läsa dessa böcker då jag hört och sett otroligt mycket om dem, och var emot dem. Tillslut kände jag dock att för att kunna vara emot dem måste jag läsa dem och försöka förstå hypen. 
Jag kan väl lite förstå det, som jag sa är Hoover skicklig på att få in läsaren, men tycker inte att den sticker ut tillräckligt för att förtjäna hypen. 

Antar att många av er läst dessa böcker. Vad tyckte ni? ☺️ förtjänar de hypen?

This was definitely a #bookstagrammadenedoit read, and while I wasn’t totally “wowed” by it, it also didn’t completely let me down - I feel very conflicted about this one. 

It was a super fast read, which usually speaks to the pace and interest, and in this regard, I feel like it met my expectations.  I was curious about how it all came together in the end, but at the same time, I wasn’t particularly engaged - I didn’t feel like I was ravenously devouring the book, eager to see what happened next, it was more like I was a passive bystander.  I didn’t have any of those heart-thumping suspenseful moments that this genre can offer, and I’m kind of bummed about it. 

The ending was definitely clever and well done - the surprise twist was honestly excellent - but for some reason, lacked some of the pomp and circumstance that was its intention.  Again, maybe it was because I didn’t get that heart-quickening sense of being unable to put it down, so when I flipped the last page, I just didn’t feel amazed about it as a whole, when frankly, I probably should have. 

All in all, a definitely decent read; maybe if I didn’t grow up watching an inappropriate amount of detective shows, it would have had more shock value.  But, I definitely see its appeal and I will absolutely read The Maidens - especially because this guy is clearly into his Greek heritage and I enjoy his unique interjection of it into his novels.

It was a lot of words that amounted to a lot of nothing until the last page. The first few dozen pages pulled me in and disturbed me. I recoiled in horror. I thought - wow, I don’t think I’ll read anything as dark again, at least until the next book by Tiffany McDaniel comes out. But then, shortly after those pages, the entire book fell off, and I’m sorry… I just do not get it.

18259635832192372;"This book had such potential and as I read the prologue I was sure it was going to be one I loved. Unfortunately I was wrong. While it highlights many important issues relating to urban Native Americans, it does so in a disjointed, confusing way. There are 12 characters whose stories are all over the place and I found it difficult to feel deep connections to most of them. Almost all of the characters had major flaws—there were drug addicts, alcoholics, overeaters, criminals…I’m not sure why the author plays into stereotypes when he could have given Native people a more nuanced depiction. There were some strong passages and a lot of poignant descriptions of people and their lives but overall the story fell flat for me.📚

Once More With Feeling 
Author: Elissa Sussman

Rating:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.💫

Notes: I received a copy of this book as an advanced reader but all thoughts and opinions are my own. 

What I Liked:
🎭This is the second book from Elissa Sussman that I’ve read. I really enjoy her style, particularly how she alternates between the past and the present. I think it helps you understand the characters and their motivations, while also acting as a juxtaposition for where they are currently in life. 

🎭Man do I love a hero who pines for the heroine since childhood. This book does that so well!

🎭This book does a great job addressing that sometimes what we see as a public persona is not really who someone is. Especially in a world that revolves around social media, the reminder is important. 

What I Didn’t Like:
🎭 I really wish that when we see Ryan in present day, time had hit him. I mean, is balding too much to ask for?? 👨🏼‍🦲

🎭Never a huge fan of a third act breakup. I could tell it was coming, but man sometimes I wish it wasn’t so inevitable. 

Final Thoughts: 
🎭This book took me by surprise. It was more emotional than I was expecting. Also this should come with a warning, that you will immediately want to start adding musical soundtracks to your Spotify playlist (Certainly not complaining about that one!)

Thank you atriabooks for the gifted copy of The Key to My Heart and Kiss Her Once for Me {partner}

✨The Key to My Heart by Lia Louis

The Key to My Heart was a beautiful story about dealing with the pain of navigating grief and learning how to live and, possibly, love again. I loved reading and listening along as Natalie's character grew. Don't get me wrong, there were times that I was left sad, but the beauty of Louis' writing is that the sadness is never for long. 

I recommend reading The Key to My Heart if you enjoy character-driven stories. 

✨Kiss Her Once For Me by Alison Cochran 

Oooof, this is painful for me because I know this will be a very unpopular opinion, but I didn't love Kiss Her Once For Me. After reading (and LOVING) The Charm Offensive last year, I had such high expectations. 

A lot was going on within this book, but one of the most significant issues is that I struggled with the whole instalove thing. I can't understand how someone could fall in love with someone else one day and spend the next year pining over them. I also didn't feel the chemistry between Ellie and Jack - something was there, but I needed more to keep me invested in their story.

I want you to read Kiss Her Once For Me and love it because I think Alison Cochran is a phenomenal writer, and I will happily read her next book. 

You can find my full review for both books on my blog (link in bio). 

What's a bucket list item you crossed off this year?

Remarkably Bright Creatures - Shelby Van Pelt
Goodreads rating: 4.47
Type: Contemporary Fiction
Format: Physical / Audio combo

This was a bit of a slow burn but overall I enjoyed the quirky characters and heartwarming story. I think I was in the mood for something a little more fast paced but the audio really helped me get through it and I loved the voice for Marcellus (the octopus). It took me a while to feel attached to any of the characters but once I did, I had to see how the story played out. An unlikely friendship, a young man with nothing left to lose on a mission to find his birth dad, and a small close knit town. There was a lot to love about this book, I’m just not sure it would be one I strongly recommend if you want a book to get completely lost in. It really didn’t come together for me until nearly the end. I’ve seen such glowing reviews so maybe it’s just me 🤷🏻‍♀️

My thoughts on the characters:

Marcellus, what an oddly relatable character. Yes, I’m talking about the Octopus 😂 I’m not sure if it’s the fact that we’re starting to live more freely in a post Covid world or the restricted life I’ve felt being a mom with two young kiddos but I greatly related to his need to break free and explore. He was a fun character and definitely made the book for me.

Cameron I found to be very annoying but he kind of gave me little brother vibes. You know… the one who constantly makes questionable decisions and you kind of just want to ring their neck a little bit 😂

Tova, sweet Tova. I mostly enjoyed seeing her relationships play out with the other characters in the book. She was quirky, kind and a good hearted person. It was a character you could easily root for and who you want things to play out well for.

Not my top pick but still an enjoyable read. It’s a good one if you’re looking for something uplifting and don’t mind it being a bit predictable ❤️";2023-01-18 15:59:36+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:08.895965+00:00;17;81;en

A Dance With Dragons is the fifth installment of George RR Martins (A Song of Ice and Fire) series. I have avoided this book like the plague for various reasons. One in being that it is a MONSTER of a book or what we call big books in the book community (a tomb). I was completely intimidated by its whopping 959 pages! Also, I was watching the HBO series while reading the books and there became some major differences between the books and the show which became a nightmare in trying to remember what happened in the show and what happened in the books.

I am so glad I waited to read this book since the show 100% deviated from the book. It's like HBO decided ""ehh we don't like where Martin was going with this so we will just do what we want with it"" and BOOM HBO completely flubbed up Martin's masterpiece! (Ok ok I am getting off topic. Back to the book review!)

I must admit that A Dance with Dragons was upsetting for me. I found it stale and boring If I am being completely honest. There were some high points. I enjoyed Theon Greyjoy's point of view and his capture by Ramsey Bolton and that storyline. Daenerys story is always a favorite especially since the fourth book almost cuts her out completely. Sansa was no where to be found because Martin did state he was focusing more on what was going on in the North and Slavers Bay. 

What was most disheartening was the fact that I was completely and utterly bored with Tyrion and Jon Snows story line. Martin really dragged things out and it took forever for characters to get to where they were going. In no way did this book need to be almost a 1000 pages. Truthfully, this tomb sent me into a reading slump. I found myself skimming pages just so I could finish. One positive note, George RR Martin is a master story teller and I like where this story is going. I am excited to see how he ends this series (if he ever gets around to finishing it) after HBO botched the last season. I just hope the pace picks up and it is as enjoyable and thrilling as the first four books.";2021-12-08 18:15:14+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:08.895965+00:00;36;405;en

A court of silver flames by Sarah J Maas
⭐️⭐️⭐️

[unpopular opinion ahead!]

Oh, I was so excited to go back to Prythian... and I was left disappointed.

I never liked Nesta in the other books, and I really hoped to change my mind with this one. It didn't happen, if possible I disliked her even more in this book. She comes across as selfish, cold, and just evil, hurting others just because she can't deal with the problems she caused in the first place by being arrogant and entitled. She has powers but she doesn't care to discover what they are or to master them, not even if that means helping her family and friends. Until the end that is, when she came across like the amazing saviour... but she wasn't redeemed in my eyes.

The story... well nothing really happens until the last ~200 pages... the other ~ 600 was her being horrible, or long, cringy sex scenes. Too many details... I mean, 10 pages at a time of her and Cassian going at it, with details that honestly made my skin go cold. In this case, LESS IS MORE, 100% (and this is classed as young adult?! It was too much even for me, and I'm way over the young adult age group).

And I missed Rhys and Feyre, they fell in the background and it was a shame.

Overall, when the action was there it was good, and I enjoyed meeting my dear bat boys again, but I was expecting a lot more.

17885018411500954;"❄️Book Review❄️

Chasing Manhattan by John Gray

This was our December book club pick. We read the first book in the series last year. I remember that it wasn’t perfect but it had a lot of heart. I enjoyed the small town vibes and the big hearted characters. I was excited to continue on with Chase’s story with this book. 

I have to say that I didn’t love this one. The story felt very disjointed. There was too much going on. I felt like the subject matter was just hopping from one character to the next, one subplot to the next without the cohesion of the first book. The dialogue was stilted and at times unrealistic. The “magic” moments seemed forced. I did like the idea of a dog rescue cafe. I also liked Matthew and Raylan as a characters. However, I feel like they never got the development that they desperately needed. I think there is a third book coming out but I will be stopping the series here. ⭐️⭐️💫

QOTD: Today is my 10 year wedding anniversary. We met while working together. How did you meet your significant other? If you don’t have a significant other…how did you meet your best friend?

18033904651404860;"When you hear “V12 Ferrari”, what is the first model that comes to mind? F12 maybe the 812? Now how about “gated manual V12s”? Certainly the 599, and Maranello variants are the only ones correct? Well….not necessarily, it really started in 1948 with the Ferrari 166 Inter. This was the true start of the front engine V12 grand tourer for Ferrari. Fast forward to 2004 and you have this very controversial looking front engine V12 prancing horse. Which is actually the predecessor to what we all know as the Ferrari FF. Unfortunately this particular one was not a gated example but nonetheless is a pretty rare car. Less than 3030 612 Scaglietti models were made for the entire world. She comes with the same exactly 5.7L V12 found in the 575M Maranello however power output is up from 508bhp to 533bhp and 434lb-ft at 5250rpm. This is a 2+2 which means you have a useable rear seat and a large boot for those grocery store runs. 

Fun facts: so as some of you eagle eyed followers might be able to tell. The front end of the 612 looks highly familiar to the 599. There’s a reason for that. This car was built in conjunction with pininfarina_official and the legendary ken_okuyama_design Okuyama san was the designer of the 599. However this is where it gets hardcore. Not only did he design the 599, but also the legendary Ferrari Enzo. It doesn’t stop there either, he was also one of the designers on the New Sport car eXperimental project code name: NSX 🤯 that’s right the guy is a complete legend in automotive history. There’s also a few more he designed such as the 456, California and 5th generation Maserati Quattroporte. Also for all of us residing in Japan. If you’ve ever taken the Shinkansen, chances are it was designed by Ken Okuyama.

With a title like that, i couldn’t wait to pick this one up. It’s got a lot of nostalgia from old horror flicks. I also loved the setting for this one. Having grown up in Florida with hurricanes, felt at home in this one 😆

With that said. I wanted more thrill. I didn’t really feel too connected to the characters or the storyline. I liked the atmosphere but i wasn’t too into the story. But it’s got a 3.91 rating on goodreads and I’ve seen a ton of rave reviews so maybe it’s just me! As always take any review with a grain of salt and form your own opinion. You may love it!

Wenn du einen Menschen anfährst, dann bremst du. 
Springst panisch aus dem Auto, leistest erste Hilfe, rufst den Krankenwagen.
Eigentlich klar. 
Aber was, wenn du selbst Arzt bist und auf den ersten Blick siehst, dass dieser Mensch dort vor dir auf dem Asphalt keinerlei Überlebenschance hat, die Verletzungen zu stark, das Krankenhaus zu weit entfernt? Wenn es dazu noch tief in der Nacht und noch tiefer im Niemandsland ist, wo weit und breit kein Mensch ist, der den Unfall bezeugen kann? Setzt du dann deinen Job aufs Spiel, riskierst du, dass deine Kinder ohne Vater aufwachsen müssen? Dass deine Familie auseinandergerissen wird?

Als Etan Grien eines nachts auf der Heimfahrt von einer endlos langen Krankenhausschicht einen Eritreer überfährt, beschließt er: Nein. Nein, er kann nicht sein Leben und das seiner Familie zerstören für eine Wahrheit, die niemandem mehr hilft. Und so fährt er weiter, nachhause, den Mann immer weiter hinter sich zurücklassend dort auf der einsamen Straße, und seinen Anblick doch für immer tief ins Gedächtnis gebrannt. Nie hätte er erwartet, wie sehr ihn in den folgenden Tagen, Wochen und Monaten dieses Bild verfolgen würde. Und nie hätte er erwartet, dass am nächsten Morgen plötzlich die Frau des Überfahrenen vor seiner Haustür stehen, geschweige denn, dass er plötzlich illegal Geflüchtete behandeln würde.

Wo fange ich an? Der Roman hat mich komplett zwiegespalten zurückgelassen. Die Story an sich mochte ich sehr und gerade der ethisch-moralische Aspekt daran hat es mir angetan. Meine anfängliche Vorfreude ist dann aber schon recht bald merklich abgeflacht, weil ich nach den ersten spannenden Seiten zunehmend die Konzentration beim Lesen verloren habe - zu häufig ist mir Gundar-Goshen vom eigentlichen Geschehen abgeschweift, hat den Fokus auf Details in Nebenhandlungen gelegt, die es für mich nicht gebraucht hätte (also, sowohl die Details als auch manche der Nebenhandlungen insgesamt).

Also back to the shelf saga, I think I have a plan.

17978450306029224;"ATTENZIONE: opinione estremamente impopolare, leggere solo se si ha una mentalità molto aperta.
L' amore viene definito da molte persone come un sentimento meraviglioso, quello che sta alla base di tutto quanto e del quale a quanto sembra non possiamo proprio fare a meno. Io però non la penso affatto così, crescendo ho potuto vedere come l'amore sia estremamente crudele e selettivo, si soffre per amore, e addirittura si uccide per amore, l'amore è solo tra singole persone, non esiste un amore comune e generale, quando due persone si amano si dimenticano di tutto il resto, non si ricordano di tutte le altre persone lì fuori che hanno bisogno di essere amate allo stesso modo, a loro non importa più, l'importante è chiudersi in una casa con ""l'anima gemella della propria vita"", dando importanza solo a quella determinata persona. Ma si può veramente chiamare amore questo? È veramente qualcosa di positivo? Io proprio non voglio crederci, l'amore non deve essere tra due persone, deve essere comune, deve essere al servizio del mondo intero, NESSUNO deve rimanere fuori dall'amore. Per me è veramente dura accettare l'attuale concetto umano di ""amore"", finché non vedrò un effettivo cambiamento di questo concetto (che penso non avverrà mai) io non crederò all'amore.

  I did not enjoy The Guest List, Where the Crawdads Sing, or The Midnight Library if I'm being honest.

  The Guest List description was giving me serious Agatha Christie vibes and it 100% let me down. It was slow and monotonous the last three chapters had the most action.
 I think Where the Crawdads Sing was too hyped up and honestly some of the events seemed extremely unrealistic. Just an OK read for me. 
  With The Midnight Library I expected way more than I got. As someone who suffers with depression, it didn't seem like a very accurate description. And it got pretty redundant. Then when she leaves the dream everything is all hunky dory. I was not that impressed, though the concept of seeing different outcomes was kind of cool.

Okay listen, I loved Zodiac Academy when I read it earlier this year and I flew through the first 3 books but then it literally took me 5 months to get through book 4 and it was literally like 600 pages and absolutely nothing happened until the last 100 pages of the book. I absolutely hate that, I still love these characters but I can’t stand when authors just like stretch shit out just to make the books longer with no actual plot, sometimes a story can be told in 200 pages sometimes 500 but if it can be told in 200 then there’s absolutely no reason to make that shit longer.

The London Sceance Society by Sarah Penner

While original in its portrayal of the spiritualist movement in Europe in the late 1800s, Sarah Penner’s latest novel ultimately disappoints. After a lengthy and dry exposition, we are finally teased with an interesting heroine who nonetheless remains shallowly drawn and unlikeable and a mystery far too easily unveiled. 

Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for my free copy. These opinions are my own.

You thought the largest and most ambitious collab was avengers end game? You were wrong!! Chimera is a massive collab album where legendary producers like Neru, PinocchioP and Inabakumori and illustrators like nou and trcoot worked together to create absolute masterpieces. Some songs on it are semi well known in the western fandom like Franken X or Sakura Tattoo but the fact that they’re all part of the same album was news to me! I found a really well made website made for the album that has all the info you need to know, I would strongly recommend checking it out as well as listening to the album ofc.

Don’t hate me, but the Book of the Year just didn’t do it for me… 
I was very excited when I got to pick this one for my December box for Book of the Month, after seeing so many great reviews. 

Unfortunately, I didn’t like either of the main characters, and never grew to like them. The first 75% of the book read like teenaged drama, and could have all been avoided with communication and quite frankly, some needed therapy. The ending was not enough for me to make up for the  repeatedly selfish actions of the main characters. 
I did find the retro video game references enjoyable. 🎮

I always say, just because I didn’t enjoy a book doesn’t mean that you won’t! 
Now back to my Christmas wrapping. 🤣

The Sanatorium by: Sarah Pearse 

Overall Rating: 8/10 

When I first started reading this book I noticed the low rating it has on Goodreads (3.37) and had seen some recent really bad reviews of 1 and 2 stars. So as I was reading and liking the story, I kept thinking to myself “great I’m liking it and it’s going to end badly and I’m going to hate it”. So I kept waiting for the moment where I was going to take a turn and start to not like it, but it never came. I actually really liked it? And liked it so much that I’m confused what other people didn’t like about it? Even though it was long, I still thought it was full of good story and plot. I will say, if you haven’t read it yet, don’t go into it thinking it’s going to be some super believable suspense novel, it is loosely believable. But do we need all thrillers to feel like they could really happen in order for the story to be good? I think there’s a place for these kinds of novels! I’m looking forward to reading Elin’s next mystery!

Title: The Cheat Sheet
Author: Sarah Adams
Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️

🔊Song Pairing: Secret Love Song - Little Mix

📖What actually happens:

Bree and Nathan have been best friends since high school. Bree runs her own dance studio. Nathan is a football player in the NFL. They have loved each other since they met and yet neither know how the other feels. Now they must fake date….

🗯Thoughts:

Let me start by saying friends to lovers is one of my least favourite tropes. If you are attracted to someone it is instant in my opinion. If something emerges over years you’re just bored.

I honestly don’t think there was much substance to Nathan at all. He kind of has a three way track mind. Bree, football and gains. I wouldn’t be surprised if he used more energy converting oxygen into carbon dioxide than coming up with an original thought. However, I will say by the very end he did have some development. 

Bree is kind of ditzy, that annoying girl you can’t ever go drinking with because you just know you’ll have to chase after her and then hold her hair later when she’s vomiting while professing her love about absolutely everything. Gtf away from me. How is this girl a lifelong ballerina when it seems she has zero grace and doesn’t know her way around a bobbypin… I thought the “brinquets” she gives to friends were super cute and did add a thoughtful quality about her. However, at the same time she’s that grandmother giving you useless crap and butterscotch because she remembers that you like cats when you actually don’t. 

For two people who worked so hard to achieve their dreams in both of their athletic careers. It ASTOUNDS ME that these two cannot get their act together. You’ve loved each other for nearly a decade and you’re scared?! 

I feel bad for anyone who has dated these two in the past. They only have eyes for each other but have chosen friendship, trying to find a placeholder until they figure out love was there all along…nah man

Overall, the characters didn’t  feel real. It was too perfect in a way that had my gagging (not the sexy kind) more than I’d care for. 

Thank you mybiblioescape for the copy!

17845434278680289;"I am not having good luck with Louise Erdrich books! 🙈 Prior to reading THE SENTENCE, the only other one of hers I had read was FUTURE HOME OF THE LIVING GOD which I did not like, at all. So I started THE SENTENCE with some trepidation but quickly fell in love with it because who doesn’t love a book about books? I was intrigued by the Ojibwe protagonist Tookie, a woman who was previously incarcerated and is now married to an ex-cop. ⁣
⁣
Tookie works in an independent bookstore, where she is haunted by the ghost of her most annoying customer Flora. Flora was a white woman who tried to convince herself and others that she was actually Indigenous, inventing a hazy past for herself. Tookie considers that Flora may have been killed by a sentence she read in a book and tries to uncover what really happened. I loved reading about Tookie’s customers and their tastes in books; that part was so much fun—and also who doesn’t know a random white lady who constantly talks about her probably nonexistent Indigenous heritage?⁣
⁣
So up until this point I was loving THE SENTENCE, but unfortunately about halfway through it dives straight into COVID-19 and mostly abandons the ghost story, perhaps as if COVID-19 happened when the author was halfway through writing. I just wasn’t ready to read a book about COVID, and I doubt I will be for a very, very long time. If you feel more prepared to read about this topic, then maybe you’ll enjoy THE SENTENCE more than I did. ⁣

Would love to hear your thoughts if you’ve read this one, and also feel free to recommend me an Erdrich book that I should pick up! Thank you harperbooks for this ARC.";2021-11-13 23:05:24+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:12.807945+00:00;58;326;en

Book: Survive the night
Author: Riley Sager
Rating: 4 stars

Unpopular opinion, I really enjoyed this one!
We meet Charlie in the beginning of this story. She has lost her parents in a car accident. At the funeral something snaps in her brain, and she begins the see movies in her head. Fast forward a couple years and Charlie went to college, where her best friend gets killed by the Campus Killer. She feels really guilty after leaving her friend alone at the bar after a fight, so her friends has to walk home alone. Charlie wants to go home and decides to use the college ride share board where she meets Josh. He is a stranger who works on the campus and wants to go home for a family emergency. When they are on the road, Charlie realises that things that Josh says don't add up. Is she seeing movies in her head or is Josh the Campus Killer and is she in danger?

The tension in this book was so good! It kept me hooked and I couldn't stop listening to the audiobook. Was Charlie stupid at times? Yes. Do you get into a car with a complete stranger, knowing there is a killer on the loose? No. But this story was so entertaining. There was one plot hole later into the book, but it didn't lessen the enjoyment for me. 

I know I'm in the minority with this one, but if this books sounds interesting to you, I would say give it a try. I think it's a fun book to get you into the thriller genre.

17934085192962503;"Could you live with doing that to your child?

I see so many people wear their disability like a badge of honor. Like being disabled has made them a better person than they could be if they were 'normal'. These beliefs are (to me) insane but if it helps them sleep/get through the day that's fine. What boils my blood is when this disability positivity bullshit goes so far that it convinces potential parents that their selfish need to have a child overrides that child's right to a GOOD PHYSICALLY PAINLESS life. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but most if not all disabilities include some sort of #pain or discomfort. Of course it varies, but intense conditions like MD, there is no escape. Even if your #baby was #born into a utopia where disability #discrimination was gone, he'd still physically suffer his whole short life. No amounts of spiffy new ramps help when your #muscles are literally deteriorating...

I think disabled #parents want their kids to be like them. An us against the world thing. Which is understandable but not worth creating a broken human (I mean physically broken, not in a mean way).

My worst fear is becoming #pregnant. If I brought a baby into this messed up world KNOWING it would have MD, I feel like I should be punished. There's enough people in the world, we don't need anymore, let alone those with heart wrenching conditions.
My mum and dad had no idea I could have MD and mum said had they known, they wouldn't have had kids. 

I understand this is touchy, when you're talking about people's kids, but it really upsets me knowing what lies ahead for so many future disabled babies. 

Just my unpopular opinion on a heavy nuanced issue.

18044887579367040;"#bookreview Have you read any sci-fi books in 2022?

I finally picked up Project Hail Mary this month, after intense badgering from my brother. And seeing all the rave reviews on Bookstagram. 

I am conflicted here, because it was an entertaining read indeed, and I am glad I read it. Some passages were really funny, other moving. Many were educational. I loved that teaching was portrayed in a positive way. Also fun to see Lyon (my hometown) briefly mentioned as well.

However, more than halfway through the book, I realised that all the info dump was not going to stop, and that the science and maths were getting more and more complicated. 

I now realise that I much prefer dystopia to ""pure"" sci-fi. (I do love sci-fi movies and series though)

In Project Hail Mary, flashbacks to Earth are composed of caricatural side characters. I would have liked to get their side of the story more.

In short - if you are a science/Maths/sci-fi buff, then this will most likely be a top read for you. Make sure you go in blind. Swipe for some of my (spoiler-free) favourite passages.

My very subjective opinion is ⭐️⭐️⭐️💫 But my fiancé, who I buddy read this with, gave it 5 stars!

Really keen to discuss further via DMs or comments if you fancy it 😀

1. Going to med school to please your African parents is something you're probably going to regret in a few months; if you want to be a DJ, go be the best DJ the world has ever seen!

❓ Q. Was könnt ihr einem Buch am schwersten verzeihen❓ 😅

📚 Zitat: „Ich bin kein freier Mensch, denn ich habe eine Schwester.“ E-Book, Position 45 📚

Mein #FederFazit 📖 zu #SCHWEIG von #JudithMerchant: 

🔸 Da ich schon lange etwas von Judith Merchant lesen wollte und der Klappentext so gut klang, konnte ich diesem Buch nicht widerstehen. 🤭 Der Winter ist auch der perfekte Zeitpunkt, um sich diesem weihnachtlichen Thriller zu widmen! 😃
 
🔸 Nun die wichtige Frage: Kann die Autorin das Potential dieser spannenden Grundidee nutzen und eine überzeugende Geschichte daraus spinnen? 🤔 Die kurze Antwort ist: Nein, leider nicht! Meine Erwartungen wurden leider nicht erfüllt und am Ende war ich ziemlich enttäuscht. 😶

🔸 Woran es lag? Leider am Gesamtpaket, denn mich hat einfach an allen Ecken und Enden etwas am Buch gestört. 🙈 Am meisten haben mich die vielen inhaltlichen Wiederholungen genervt. Die Dialoge drehen sich im Kreis, immer wieder wird das gleiche Thema durchgekaut – das war unglaublich langweilig und anstrengend zu lesen! 😴 Auch Spannung wollte ich deswegen keine einstellen – bei einem Thriller natürlich fatal. 😅 Die Wendungen, die mich vermutlich umhauen hätten sollen, fand ich einfach nur lahm – da habe ich schon viel bessere Thriller gelesen! 🤷🏼‍♀️ Zudem werden die Themen (Geschwisterrivalität, Eifersucht, Verantwortung, Macht, Manipulation, Familie) nur sehr oberflächlich abgehandelt. Ja, durchgehalten habe ich zwar bis zum Schluss (in der Hoffnung auf den EINEN großartigen, unerwarteten Twist), aber gelohnt hat sich das leider nicht. 🙁

🔸 Dazu kam, dass ich (bis auf die Kinder) ausnahmslos alle Figuren in diesem Buch entweder nur farblos oder nur unsympathisch oder BEIDES gleichzeitig fand 😅😮‍💨 und von den beiden Schwestern, ihrer toxischen Beziehung und dem ständigen „Gaslighting“ auch sehr schnell genervt war. 🙄

I find #rhonj extremely boring. I live in NJ & an extremely proud to. I just find RHONJ the most boring out of all the franchises even #rhodubai 

I’m not sure what it is but the story lines never interest me. There’s also a lack of glam and a lack of being on trend with fashion that very much annoys me. 

I also don’t like to see families on reality tv, especially children. 

Either way I watch anyway because what else is there to watch at night? 

I love melissagorga though.

From day 1 I clicked with Melissa on ever level. I love her and Joe’s relationship. I am honestly shocked by how beautiful she is and how insane her body is. Love that she opened her own business, love how she brought herself on the show, love the kind of mom she is and how close to her sisters she is. 

I love that she’s always positive and happy. 

I don’t get the whole loving crazy housewives who stir the pot thing I truly don’t.

#TheGirlontheTrain (2015) 
Quick Synopsis: Rachel catches the same commuter train every morning. She knows it will wait at the same signal each time, overlooking a row of back gardens. She’s even started to feel like she knows the people who live in one of the houses. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough.

My Thoughts: I have an unpopular opinion on this one, and I don’t consider myself highly critical of books! Throughout my reading journey this year, I’ve learned I’m inconsistent with my feelings on how I feel about unreliable narrators. Typically, an unreliable narrator will be unlikable on some level. I don’t have to like everything about a main character! There are plenty books I’ve read where the protagonist is morally gray and I can still enjoy the ride. For example, I’m currently reading The Paper Palace and enjoying every minute of it. However, something about the way this book was executed really fell short for me. I love books with multiple POV’s and The Girl on the Train is told from the perspective of three characters, but each one is more annoying than the next. The beginning of the book caught my attention and the premise had so much potential, but I disliked almost every character to the extent that I didn't care about what happened to anyone as I didn’t find them compelling at all. I basically only finished to find out if my theory on the big reveal was correct, which unfortunately it was. Okay, now that I’ve bashed the book…just because it didn’t work for me, doesn’t mean it won’t for you, especially considering so many readers really enjoyed this psychological thriller! That’s the great thing about books.

It's not news that I am a purebred snob. I support rescues.... but I believe that supporting backyard breeders is the reason our rescues are full and that people are frustrated with their dogs. You cannot support Backyard Breeders and Rescues at the same time - they work against each other. Good breeders screen OWNERS to make sure they can handle the breed. Good breeders breed for balance and temperament (in addition to health and structure). Good breeders make sure to weed out behavioral concerns, including unnecessary aggression or fear (breed appropriate). Good breeders will take their dogs back, NOT allowing them to go to rescues (bound by legal contract!)

Do your breed research - and do your BREEDER research, folks. Bad breeding leads to unbalanced, unpredictable dogs. Good breeding weeds that out. Good breeding will keep our shelters nearly empty. Bad breeding will fill our shelters. 

💥 Support rescues. Support GOOD ethical breeders. Don't support Backyard Breeders. 👍

Rating:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.💫

What I Liked:
💕Their meet cute was adorable and steamy (is that even a thing??) while also being one that I could relate to. We’ve all had those moments in a bar, but most of the time they don’t turn out like this!

💕THE REPRESENTATION! There is something powerful and pure about a book that so clearly represents a
particular culture. I’m not Indian, but the descriptions emitted a warmth and enabled me to so clearly picture everything that was being described in my head. I felt like I was part of the family. Beautiful storytelling, while also being meaningful! 

💕This book was WAY spicer 🌶️🌶️ than I would have expected. That shower scene 🥵. Nisha knows what she’s doing! 😏

What I Didn’t Like:
💕I actually wish we saw Prem and Kareena fall in love a bit more before the end. I’d love to see him crash a few more of her dates. I also REALLY wanted them to get married on his show!

Final Thoughts: 
💕Glad I finally caved and read this book. It had been sitting on my shelf for an embarrassingly long time. Although now that I’ve been sucked into the Nisha-verse, I’m so sad I have to wait for book 2 in this series. 😭

Vi piacciono i saggi ? 
Partiamo da qui, altrimenti non considerate nemmeno quest'opera. 

Io onestamente non li cerco molto, o almeno non tutti. Tra i miei preferiti c'è sicuramente #spillover ma è un saggio dalle tinte #noir che prediligo da quelli a tinte 'pink'
Ecco premesso questo, con 𝑈𝑛𝑎 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑧𝑎 𝑡𝑢𝑡𝑡𝑎 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑠é,  sono uscita drasticamente dalla mia confort zone . 

Vi chiedo scusa già in anticipo per quello che sto per dirvi, so che con questo mio parere sincero potrei ferire la sensibilità di alcuni lettori 🤭..

𝑈𝑛𝑎 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑧𝑎 𝑡𝑢𝑡𝑡𝑎 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑠é  è la stanza che Virginia non ha mai avuto, quella che le avrebbe permesso di scrivere in tranquillità senza continue interruzioni. La stanza che avrebbero voluto anche le altre scrittrici del suo secolo, sempre troppo poco considerate, quasi assenti prima dell'800. 

Sicuramente la tematica affrontata è importante ed è una accusa sollevata, una voce che grida di esser ascoltata .

Non è una lettura semplice, nella sua complessità la Wolf comunque riesce a catturare il lettore e  intrappolarlo  nei suoi flussi di coscienza trasportando in un mondo costellato di poesia .

𝑈𝑛𝑎 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑧𝑎 𝑡𝑢𝑡𝑡𝑎 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑠é è un saggio che  rappresenta un grande manifesto per il movimento femminista del '900 e ripercorre le condizioni della donna dal '500 al '900.
Offre un'ampia dissertazione del rapporto delle donne nella letteratura e sulla difficoltà che hanno nell'affermarsi nella società.

Ve lo dico così a bruciapelo. 
Non mi è piaciuto. 
Non un libro da leggere con leggerezza,  tanto per capirci. 
Troppo noioso per i miei gusti. 
Sono una persona che viene attratta da letture più accattivanti che riescano a  tenermi incollata alle pagine.

Non odiatemi, vi prego, so che è molto apprezzata. 

Anche  se non rientra tra le mie preferenze di lettura è comunque un libro interessante e che mi sento di consigliare a chi è alla ricerca di una lettura riflessiva , profonda,  illuminante e provocatoria.

Come sempre grazie per avermi letto ❤

18003790324538692;"🔥A Fire Endless book review!🔥

Guys, I've been sitting on this review for a few days. Because this duology seems to be extremely well loved, but I have feelings... I also had thoughts about A River Enchanted but I was hoping some of my issues would be resolved...

No spoilers here, just sharing what I think!

➡️What worked: 
✨I really love her writing and the feel of the books. Lots of fairytale and magic vibes.
✨The audiobook narrator has a fabulous accent that really adds to the story.
✨The characters are very likeable.
✨The overall arc of the plot was interesting. And I like the way it ended.

➡️It's been harder to pin down what didn't work as well for me. The whole time I kept asking myself why I felt skeptical, why I wasn't loving these books like others do.
✨ I've come to the conclusion that some parts of these books didn't CONVINCE me. Like the characters made choices for the sake of moving the plot along. Or the choices didn't seem to fit the characters as they had been established.
✨I thought the world building could have been fleshed out a bit better. The spirits' roles seemed quite random. And the final resolution to their conflict seemed too easy. 

Dang, that sounds so harsh. Truly I think there's a lot to love about this duology. As TSwift would say, ""I'm the problem, it's me."" 😉😉 I'm a very logical person so I prefer books that have a solid structure in the world. Rules and laws even in a fantasy world. Sometimes I struggle with fantasy that feels too simplistic. 

So yeah, I liked these but didn't love them. Unpopular opinion. But I can see why people love these so definitely give them a try if you're considering it!

Tags: #fantasyromance #retelling #duology #enemiestolovers

¿Sabéis esa sensación cuando leéis un libro y conectáis 0 con la historia? Eso es lo que me ha pasado con este 😥

'Una violeta hecha de espinas' parte de una premisa que tenía todas las de ganar, siendo una comparativa entre 'El príncipe cruel' y 'Asesino de brujas' pero aunque la idea tenga un poco de esas historias y sea buena, el desarrollo me ha dejado totalmente indiferente.

Violeta es una vidente mentirosa y de dudosa moralidad cuya idea me encanta. Es el tipo de personaje gris que me gusta, rollo Jude, pero no lo he sentido. Sí, miente, sí, tiene dudosa moralidad pero no ha sido un personaje que me ha llegado. Lo mismo me ha pasado con el resto de personajes. Tienen su puesto pero no me han llegado, los he sentido planos y como que me tenía que creer lo que decían que eran pero no lo sentía como tal.

Con el mundo me ha pasado algo parecido. Me encanta los atisbos que da de un reino corrupto y el juego que se trae con las hadas, ese tipo de trapicheos políticos que le da un toque más 'El príncipe cruel'. Pero aunque pueda entender la comparativa, a la hora de la verdad siento que distan mucho en su desarrollo. El mundo he sentido que se ha quedado muy desdibujado, en un segundo plano que no llega a adquirir la grandeza que podría tener.

Se resume en que no ha sido para mi. No es un libro que me haya molestado mientras leía sino más bien que no me tiraba especialmente a continuar. La narración es sencilla, quizá demasiado para mi gusto, al igual que la historia y como se desarrolla todo. Una buena idea cuyo desarrollo simplemente no me ha atrapado en ningún momento, no me ha causado intriga ni sus personajes me animaban especialmente a continuar.

⁣
✨The Bear and the Nightingale by Katherine Arden ✨⁣
⁣⁣
Unpopular Opinion Incoming: This was utterly disappointing. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I'm all for beautiful atmospheric fairy tale retellings but I need a semblance of a plot. I need the book to have a point. I was bored less than halfway through but so many of my friends love this one that I forced myself to finish. When I asked people who have read it when the plot starts the response I got was ""the second book."" I'm sorry, that doesn't cut it for me. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
You can't write an entire first book that has a meandering plot with too many pointless characters and storylines and then expect me, the reader, to happily pick up the next book? I'll give this two stars for a creative concept and somewhat atmospheric, beautiful writing but that doesn't make a good book. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
There are entire chapters dedicated to characters who serve no purpose in furthering the story along. There are so many details that are written in a way that seems like they're important or that hint at some bigger plot point that just end up being irrelevant. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I think her lovely prose hides a lot and is maybe why so many people love this one, but for me it didn't mask the lack of plotting and movement. I absolutely love magical fairy tale retellings with atmospheric writing and so naturally the way this is pitched I thought I would love this as well but overall it just felt like a drag to read. I was only interested in the main character but it switched away from her so often to other pointless characters I couldn't fall into a rhythm. I also thought the winter king would be more of a character but it was just more background and detail that didn't actually pan out into the story. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I hate being disappointed by a hyped book but it happens. I'm clearly in the minority here so if you're interested give it a shot but this fairy tale and fantasy lover was wholly disappointed. ⁣⁣

- Sarah J. Maas, A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)

Oggi parliamo di serie che vengono pubblicate a molti anni di distanza. Se per alcune posso anche capirne la motivazione, ad esempio per la complessità della storia, si sto parlando di Martin, altre per me riescono solo a far perdere interesse anche ai fan più accaniti. E in questo preciso momento sto pensato alla serie di ACOTAR di Sarah J. Maas.

Ormai con questa serie ho un legame altalenante, un momento l’adoro, quello dopo provo solo una grande noia nei suoi confronti e devo ammettere che i tre anni tra un volume e l’altro non aiutano. Se a questo aggiungiamo le mille battaglie inutili nel fandom, la mia pazienza sta raggiungendo dei minimi storici. 

Inoltre credo che aspettare così tanto a dare una “voce” a certi personaggi non provochi che problemi. Cerco di spiegarvi cosa intendo facendo un esempio riguardante Azriel (no, non parliamo della stupida guerra tra ship).
Da quando ho letto ACOMAF il mio personaggio preferito della serie è Azriel. Leggendo mi sono immaginata un personaggio di un certo tipo, cosa che la Maas non è mai andata a smontare, visto che non siamo mai stati nella sua testa… almeno fino ad ACOSF. Quando ho letto il capitolo dal suo punto di vista devo dire di essere rimasta un po’ delusa da chi mi sono ritrovata davanti. Ripeto, non per la ship, ma per il suo modo di pensare. Per ben quattro anni nella mia testa mi ero creata l’immagine di un personaggio, che poi nel giro di poche pagine è stata completamente smontata per ritrovarmi con la versione 2.0 di Rhysand e Cassian. Da una parte è colpa mia, ma devo ammettere che la mia delusione è anche colpa della Maas e dei tempi estenuanti che bisogna attendere per conoscere veramente un personaggio. 

Al momento vorrei proprio che avesse concluso la serie con ACOWAR.

So I finally finished Hoover’s Maybe Someday series. The last one being Maybe Now. 

Swipe ➡️ for summary

Okay like I said this summer I don’t get the hype around this book or series. I thought Maybe Now wasn’t needed and was quite repetitive of Maybe Someday. I did enjoy Maggie’s POV and would have loved more of that. But the Ridge and Sydney story was burnt already. We got it all in Maybe Someday. Unpopular opinion? Maybe. But this one just wasn’t for me.

I love CoHo but this was a miss for me.

⭐⭐⭐

Today I come with a mini review that has been hard to write as I am a huge SJM fan but...HOSAB was not what I expected...

I'll still read book 3 as I think SJM is a formidable writer but House of Sky and Breath left me disappointed somehow.

What I adored:

--I loved all the side characters (you get some new ones) and their own ""stories within the story"". Sarah J Maas writes amazing main and side characters;

-I loved how Ruhn 's character grew,

-I loved that I was sucked right into the story;

-I ship Bryce and Hunt;

-I love Bryce I  particularly adore her snark and witty comebacks. She is smart, caring, courageous and witty.🤩

BUT

--the storyarc was all over the place!  I didn't see a drive , a real ""quest"" in this story. 

--the big reveal! I was all: ""Seriously? You want to go that way???"" 

I am perfectly aware that I am the black sheep here and that the vast majority of readers adore the book. And that makes me very happy for Sarah J Maas as she is a formidable writer and still my favorite author! I'll read Crescent City 3 without a doubt!
And I think my 3 stars are partly due to me having very high standard and expectations for Sarah J Maas.

All comments are welcome but please, be respectful.

18155096365284824;"HOW NOT TO DROWN IN A GLASS OF WATER by Angie Cruz is about Cara Romero, a Dominican American woman in her mid-50s living in the Bronx who just lost her job at a lamp factory. The novel is a monologue of her spilling her life story to her employment counselor over the course of twelve sessions. In these monologues, Cara recounts her life’s losses (a violent husband, an estranged son) as well as the caring, interdependent, and sometimes thorny relationships she has with her family and friends.

There’s good commentary in the book about the strength of single moms, the symbiosis of community, the struggles of being an immigrant, and the precariousness of working-class jobs in America. Some readers will find Cara’s unapologetic feistiness to be endearing, and I think Cruz accomplished her goals in how she structured the novel and character arc.

The audiobook (narrated by Kimberly Wetherell and Rossmery Almonte) really brings Cara to life, but to be honest, I did not enjoy her as a person. I know part of the point of the book is that she’s oblivious to her own deficiencies (such as her homophobia), but her “I’m an amazing woman” attitude grated on me, even if there was grief buried under the surface. Does she start to become a little more introspective and honest with herself towards the end of the book? Yes, but I had to sit through her gaslighting herself for the first 80%. Plus, there is no real accountability or reckoning for the tremendous harm she has done to her son’s life. It seemed like the message was “Love overcomes all”, but I am skeptical and allergic to the kind of love that thinks it knows best for others. 

If you pick this up, do try the audiobook version, which is produced with sound effects and all. I know many other bookstagrammers liked this novel, so maybe you will, too!

BOOK REVIEW
Hidden Pictures by Jason Rekulak
Pub date: May 10, 2022
373 pages

This is one of the hardest reviews I’ve had to write (and I wrote and post reviews for all of the books I read, no matter what), which is why I’ve put it off for so long. 

This book starts off so good. What the illustrations added to the story was unlike anything else I’ve picked up. As someone local to the town this story takes place in (the fictional Spring Brook, NJ is inspired by another actual NJ town), I could easily connect with the setting. I loved that there were sprinkles of humor in what is ultimately a supernatural thriller. Sure, it requires suspending reality to appreciate (I’d be out of there IMMEDIATELY if I thought the kid I was babysitting was possessed 😅), but most thrillers do, right? 

What turned me off from the story really didn’t come until the end of the story. I was warned that there was a little “fat phobia,” in the text, which as a plus size woman did catch me off guard. It was sort of glossed over, but still felt a little uncomfortable to read. So, while it didn’t ruin the story for me, it might for someone else. 

But there’s something else more pressing that I don’t want to spoil it for anyone. So, if you haven’t read it and intend to, maybe you want to stop reading here. 

I was also warned that there was some transphobia in the story. While I’m willing to give the benefit of the doubt that it wasn’t the author’s intent, it does make me uncomfortable that the “twist,” of this otherwise truly fun and engaging read, was some sort of faux trans situation just still doesn’t sit well with me. It just seems like a cheap twist, first of all. This idea of this book was so unique, mostly due to the incorporated illustrations, and the twist just didn’t come off as smart as it should’ve imo. Secondly I think it was a mistake for the author (and the publisher) to conclude the story in this way. I think when you look back on the story altogether, it definitely seems disrespectful (if not wholly transphobic) to the trans community. 

What would otherwise have been a 4 star read gets ⭐️⭐️ from me";2022-12-10 16:40:30+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:17.181227+00:00;26;0;en
17941462202476091;"REVIEW: Drunk on Love by Jasmine Guillory 🍷💕💋

Jasmine Guillory is one of my auto-buy authors, so when Drunk on Love released back in September, I was super excited to read it. But then no one was posting about it on #bookstagram and then I got scared and put it off. Now I know why no one was talking about it 😬

This was easily my least favorite book of hers. Jasmine’s books are fun, bubbly, and have lots of great banter and steam. This one felt so off to me. The writing needed some major editing, I didn’t love the tropes (reverse age gap and workplace romance), and the steam was soooo cringey 🫣 I skimmed through most of it. 

I don’t love posting reviews of books I didn’t like, but I got my love of Jasmine’s books from Bookstagram, and wanted to share an honest opinion. I hope her next book delivers on all the things I usually love about her writing. This just was not it for me 👎🏻

RATING: ⭐️⭐️

It's something I typically hear this from people who are referring to how they split their time between their paid employment and their leisure time. 

Heck even I've said it myself, full disclosure! 

But here's the thing - your work is not just your job. Your work is what you choose to do with your time, whether you get paid for it or not - be that parenting, charity, creating art, teaching... You get my drift. 

And you never hear someone who loves their work talk about how they wish they had more 'work-life balance'. 

Your loves are always going to unbalance your life. The best things always do. 

So tell me, what is it that you're actually striving to balance?

18065299255342791;"#ceamcitit Luna asta am terminat 5 carti #crimethriller si din pacate nu au trecut de 3⭐️ nici una (dupa gustul meu):

1/5 ⭐️ Ruth Ware, It Girl. O mare dezamagire dupa Turn of the key. O carte in care nu se intampla nimic- o fata de bani gata, o fata modesta, un colegiu la Oxford, crima si niste increngaturi romantice. Insa fara intriga, suspans sau mister. Singurul lucru fain e coperta si ca mi-a trezit nostalgii de la Cambridge.

2/5⭐️ Tony Mott, Toamna se numara cadavrele. Primul sfert din carte era promitator si scris frumos. Apoi au inceput niste crime nerealiste. Mi s-a parut ca planul prezent si cel al amintirilor naratoarei nu se armonizeaza bine, iar pasajul in care politistul isi miroase chilotii mi-a pus capac. #unpopularopinion

2/5⭐️ Olga Tokarczuk, Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead. Mi-am dorit sa imi placa cartea, parea un basm-mister, dar din pacate nu ne-am potrivit. Este bine scrisa, insa actiunea, meditatiile despre lume si viata m-au lasat indiferenta si nu mi-a placut deloc personajul principal. Aici insa cred ca e o situatie de genul It's not you, it's me.

3/5⭐️ Alice Feeney, Rock, Paper, Scissors. Mi-a fost greu sa ma prinda povestea, apoi m-a atras cu totul, ca pana la final sa ma piarda iar. Partial cred ca tine de mine- am realizat ca nu imi plac #domesticthriller . Partial insa si pentru ca mi se pare ca exista potential (un personaj principal care are o afectiune si nu distinge fețe), dar nu a fost valorificat. Ideea de a alterna prezentul cu trecutul sub forma unor scrisori care carteaza 10 ani e faina, insa in final a devenit obositoare.

3.5/5⭐️ C.J.Tudor, Disparitia lui Annie Thorne. Nu stiu de ce presupusesem ca Tudor este un autor roman, cand de fapt este o autoare britanica 🤷‍♀️ E prima mea incercare. Cartea m-a tinut in priza, povestea e buna (mi-a adus aminte oarecum de Shadow Man de Alex North). Insa pe parcurs s-a pierdut suspansul, iar detaliile erau mai degraba scarboase decat creepy. Per total o poveste cu mult potential, dar putea mai mult.

Prove me wrong! Do you agree or disagree?

Firstly, the importance of a big breakfast being the most important meal of the day is a myth perpetuated by breakfast food companies post world war 2. Scientifically it doesn’t hold up. 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 
Secondly…it’s SO stodgy and heavy. It makes me feel rough if I eat it all or want to go and lie down. I’ve got too much life to live to do that.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 
Thirdly, the hangover cure is also a myth. What your body needs for n a hangover is the vitamins the alcohol has destroyed. Not more stodge.

Fourthly, it has the nutritional value of a massive shit. Which, by the way, it will also make your bowel movements trickier too! 💩

18333760747065740;"Review: Float Plan by Trish Doller

So unpopular opinion cause so many people adore this book but this one was hard for me.  It was so sad at parts and I didn’t always buy the romance element of it.  While I loved the love interest,  Keane, I just didn’t feel like Anna was ready to take on a new love interest after the passing of her fiancé.

There are definitely trigger warnings here for death of a significant other and struggles with a difficult family life.  There is a lot of grief here and while I feel like Trish did a great job of handling it well it’s just not what I love to read about in my romance books.  Sorry!! There is nothing wrong with the writing here just a me problem I think.  Still a solid 4 star read - just not for me.

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 4/5

Tijdens de eerste lockdown wilde ik wat tastbaars neerzetten, ik wilde mijn creatieve ideeën kunnen verwerken. Ik had nog een mooie stof liggen en ik ben gewoon begonnen. Eind april 2020 is de eerste poppendrager online gekomen en toen is Studio Billie gaan groeien.

.
¡Hola lectores! 🤗Os tragio una nueva reseña de un libro que leí hace ya bastante, pero como sabéis voy un poco retrasada con las reseñas y estoy intentando ponerme al día, por eso subo últimamente más contenido diario 🤭
El libro del que os hablo es “Pecados a la luz de la luna” de jennifer_l_armentrout y titania.ed , es un libro muy diferente con respecto a los que suele hacer Jennifer, ya que este no tiene nada de fantasía, es más bien tipo thriller juvenil mezclado con romántica. Debo decir que creo que mi opinión va a ser un poco #unpopularopinion , aunque he escuchado opiniones muy variadas 🙄
En mi caso no me disgustó del todo, creo que se ha cebado un poco con las escenas picantes y muchas de ellas me sobraban, sé que lo hace para poder identificar a un personaje en concreto y mostrarnos como es pero creo que lo podría haber retratado también de otras maneras sin que llegase a ser tan subido de tono porque en mi caso me provocó sentimientos muy diversos sin llegar a entender del todo al protagonista.
Por otro lado, es verdad que el libro en general está bien, no va a pasar a la historia como su mejor libro pero tiene una trama que engancha y entretiene, tiene misterio y suspense, factores que siempre ayudan a crear una historia dinámica, y aunque al llegar a la mitad del libro se empieza a hacer un poco cuesta arriba también es algo propio de la autora, es como si dijéramos que escribe al estilo montaña rusa, cuando subes va muy deprisa y antes de caer se toma su tiempo, pero la caída es bastante memorable ✨
Es cierto que la protagonista de este libro, me acabó dando un poco de pereza su actitud, muy diferente al resto de protagonistas 👑
En resumen, es un libro que se puede leer fácil, es dinámico y tiene una historia de amor prohibido que engancha ❤️
¿Cuál es vuestra opinión? ¿Lo habéis leído? Os leo en comentarios 🥰🥰

But... aside from Pulse Of The Meteor those aren't his most popular songs like at all. Main Character is nowhere near Heal Me, Manic or Star popularity-wise. And Attract Light is popular as a Yuaru song but the Len version isn't as big (which is sad because it's my fav *LunaLen usage). Also Bibi tuned most of *Luna's popular songs but some others are tuned by kyaami/cillia or *Luna himself

Haven't picked up a book in December yet that I could get through! #thespanishpromise by #karenswan was my first by this author and had all the ingredients of a novel I thought I'd love - romance, a different country and history but for me the parts of the story didn't gel, the characters were not likeable and I could see where the romance part was going a mile off.

18006737773524884;"Today is Valentine’s Day, and our household has pledged never to celebrate it 🫣😬. Wait! Hear me out!

danharris just released a podcast episode about this. I highly recommend a listen!!

V-day is actually a day that used to be called “Feast Day” to celebrate the state execution of St. Valentine for teaching exiled Christians about Christianity in the Roman era. How un-romantic, right?

Fast forward to today, V-day can be a lovely day to celebrate your partner and ignite a spark, as well as a marketing machine! 💰💰💝

I think it romanticizes the idea of finding “the one” that is your perfect match and treating them like royalty. That sounds beautiful in theory, but almost impossible in application. We are complicated ass human beings with so much depth and complexities that successful long term relationships can’t work this way. 

In reality, relationships are imperfect and not loving or romantic all the time. Only some of the time. Sorry to ruin it 🫣. I’m no relationship expert, but prominent thinkers and leaders in this space like estherperelofficial and #AlainDeBotton both agree: love is like money. It comes and goes. Being open, honest, respectful, forgiving, non-judgmental, and finding solutions to reoccurring problems (even when the love, passion, and intimacy are low) are key to a long lasting romantic and physical relationship. 

Basically you have to do the mundane sh** ALWAYS in order to get the fun sh** SOMETIMES. And this takes trial and error and heavy, internal, difficult WORK. One day aka Valentines Day is not sufficient enough for this to work. 

But truly, to each his own. This is just our approach to Valentines Day. Whatever your approach is works for you! With that being said, Happy Valentines Day to all those that celebrate ♥️💝

What do you think? Is this too much cynical thinking or realistic thinking?

Because socialising is great 👍

Make great memories 
Meet new friends
Learn about the space we are at 
Embrace where are visiting

No! 

Not all of his homeschool friends were doing the activities but he was.

Hamish is old enough to know the difference between time to play and time to learn.

He is also old enough to understand that often we as a family will March to the beat of our own drums and it won't look like everyone else. And in those times we need to stay focused on what we are trying to achieve.

He grumbled, he moaned and then he proudly showed his dad the activities he did today. 

Being his teacher and his mom means it's my job to guide him,motivate him, discipline him, encourage him and get the things done. 

This isn't always easy and it would have been easier to just let him play but honestly we don't go on outings to only socialize.

i just don’t really understand why people like it. for me, the song never feels like it actually starts, and sort of drags on until you realize its the end. also, maybe it’s because i’m more used to other producer’s tuning, but miku also just sounds weird imo. the lyrics are also eh. this isn’t to say i hate it; i like the general instrumental and also the mv. its just that otherwise sand planet feels very “meh” for me.

This is probably going to be an unpopular opinion but I didn't love this one 😕

I remember being absolutely wrecked by It Ends With Us and to see Lily still having in person interactions with her abuser made me highly anxious. I would like to think that if I've been thrown down stairs, bitten, shoved against walls etc. I might have suggested anger management classes and other things BEFORE my child could have visits. I don't know, it just didn't sit right with me.

And I thought the love storyline was just ok, too. 

What I actually would have liked to have read more about was Atlas and his new found brother and their relationship. I also enjoyed Theo and his humor.

📚 Book Review📚: Book Lovers by Emily Henry
🌟 rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️/5
📅 Pub Date: May 3, 2022

🚨 Unpopular Opinion Alert 🚨 

I’m going to ask the angry mob to hold on to your pitchforks a minute while I try to explain my lower rating of this booksta darling. Or you know, just focus on Stella in her adorable purple dress instead! 😂

I loved People We Meet on Vacation and enjoyed Beach Read so I was excited for Book Lovers even though it is not my go-to genre. Unfortunately I think romcoms don’t work well for me on audio - I found numerous things to be a bit cringe and also would be ok never hearing Sissy as a nickname used by a grown women again. What really didn’t work for me though was that all the conflict could have been easily resolved with a few quick conversations. The sister dynamic was a huge focus and their relationship felt off and a tad unhealthy too. This also wasn’t what I would consider enemies to lovers as one slightly awkward lunch doesn’t make you mortal enemies. 

I will say the banter was on point and I loved all the book references and tongue in cheek approach to the book troupes. There were far too many metaphors used for my taste, which again is more noticeable to me on audio. I did like the way it wrapped up and that it didn’t go a more cliché route that I had expected.

I’m sure it’s just my friend talesbysel and I over here on unpopular opinion island since everyone else loved this one. It took me a full month to finally finish it and while I’m glad I didn’t DNF it, I’m also very glad I’m done with it. 

Thanks to librofm and prhaudio for the ALC.

17921568275616927;"Warning: Long post ahead, and it's a little bananas. Did I like the book or not? You’ll have to read to the end to find out!

Those of you who remember my OH WILLIAM! review may be surprised that I picked up LUCY BY THE SEA, Elizabeth Strout’s fourth novel in her Lucy Barton series, but even if I didn’t consider OH WILLIAM! to be Booker Prize-worthy, I loved Kimberly Farr’s narration of the audiobook so much that I wanted to hear her bring Lucy to life again. Strout’s writing may not be my favorite, but she’s skillful at making beauty out of human ordinariness. Lastly, I felt ready to process the pandemic through fiction, and looked forward to how Strout would tease out that angle.

Thus, I went into LUCY BY THE SEA with a charitable mindset. I was prepared to overlook what I didn’t love about Lucy and William and just enjoy the experience for what it was. LUCY BY THE SEA follows Lucy and her ex-husband, William, as they flee NYC to quarantine from the pandemic on the coast of Maine. They’re on good terms and share two adult daughters, and the book follows their family dramas and Lucy’s daily experiences of semi-isolation during the pandemic.

Farr’s narration was once again splendid, but the book riled me up way more than I thought it would. Mostly, the amount of unacknowledged privilege was astounding. All of Lucy’s loved ones, including her daughters, have vacant houses or condos or rentals where they can escape from the city (some can even buy a home on a whim!); they can all work from home; none of them have little kids to care for; all of them have regular social interaction. The novel depicted a very sheltered bubble of the pandemic. I spent a lot of emotional energy trying not to hate them all, especially because they don’t realize how good they have it.

17978311750966248;"⚡️ RESEÑA ⚡️

Llegué a esta libro con la intención de que me gustara y de que me diera lo que necesitaba. En parte lo hizo porque me entretuvo mucho, pero lamento decir que no fue para nada lo que esperaba…

👉 La trama:
Un año después de que el marido y la hija de Diane murieran de un accidente, ella sigue encerrada en su casa abandonándose cada día a más a sí misma. Es entonces cuando, tras un debate interior importante, decide viajar a un punto remoto de Irlanda (país al que siempre había querido ir su marido) para sanar las heridas imborrables de su duelo. 

👉 Mi opinión:
Aunque hasta aquí la trama parece interesante, el resto me ha parecido tristemente decepcionante. Tras un título evocador que puede aparentar otra cosa, las expectativas me jugaron una mala pasada cuando me encontré que no había gente feliz en la historia; ni tampoco libros ni café. De hecho, lo que abunda es la cerveza… Tampoco entendí a los personajes ni por qué actuaban como lo hacían. Ni siquiera entendí que la autora fuera psicóloga y tratara el duelo con tan poca delicadeza cayendo en un melodrama innecesario. 

🤎 No obstante…
Tengo que decir que a mucha gente le encanta este libro y, por tanto, quizá es que no es para mí o lo pillé en un momento inadecuado. Al ser muy cortito os recomiendo que le deis una oportunidad porque se lee rápido y quizá es perfecto para vostr@s!

💔 Ho letto Dio di illusioni a inizio 2022 e ancora non ve ne ho parlato per bene, perché mi aspettavo tanto da questo libro ed invece non mi è arrivato dritto al cuore. 
📖 La storia narrata è intrigante, si parla di college, fratellanza, tradimenti ed omicidi. Anche lo stile un po' insolito (già dalle prime pagine si sa chi muore e chi è l'assassino, restano da capire le dinamiche dell'omicidio) nel complesso funziona. 
🙅‍♀️ Ciò che per me non ha funzionato è il ritmo davvero troppo lento, reso ancora più pesante dai capitoli troppo lunghi e pieni di pagine non necessarie in cui non succede nulla. 
⌚ Il libro è scritto dal punto di vista di Richard, in un tempo futuro rispetto agli eventi narrati, ed è una cosa che ho apprezzato. Ma a volte alcuni dialoghi o alcuni particolari non vengono riportati proprio perché il protagonista non li ricorda bene e questo non mi è piaciuto.
✍️ Lo stile di scrittura è ricercato ed elegante, ma l'ho trovato un po' pesante per i miei gusti per questo non l'ho pienamente apprezzato.

Rating: ⭐️

This is a revised rating from my original review. Sometimes I need to sit with a book for a while and see if my immediate feelings were correct. I think I am influenced by others to think I should like something and to try and find redeeming qualities about books. But the more I thought about this book the more I hated it. 

I hated the characters. I hated the relationships. The star is for Cap and Cap only. Every time I see a 1 star review for this I feel seen. This book honestly made me not want to pick up another Colleen Hoover book because I’ve heard many of her books are more of the same toxic relationship mess and I’ve decided that’s just not something I find enjoyment in. Especially when it’s portrayed as real love. 

But as always, different strokes for different folks. If this is your yum then I will try not to yuck it. 🙃But please know I hate it with a passion.

UN CUENTO PERFECTO - ELÍSABET BENAVENT 

¡Hola lectores!💕📚

✨ Un cuento perfecto que para mí no lo fue para nada.

✨ Tengo mucho que decir sobre lo que no me gustó de este libro, pero siento que si lo hago con detalles revelaría toda la trama y no me gusta hacer spoilers. Así que simplemente diré que no fue para mí. 

✨ Esperaba mucho con este título, pero no encontré tanto, les comento:

✨ Lo primero es que no pude empatizar con los personajes o la trama, no estuve de acuerdo con sus valores y decisiones, es todo; además, para las edades que decían tener eran muy inmaduros y solo se vivían justificando por cosas que hacían y sabían que estaba mal.

✨ Esperaba que la ambientación fuera diferente, más detallada, con más descripciones, pero no, fue como ir de viaje y quedarse trancados en el hotel o el aeropuerto.

✨ El final no pudo ser peor a mi pensar 🤐 ¿en serio, eso era todo? Los que lo han leído me entenderán.

✨ Y concluyendo diría, que le han sobrado muchísimas páginas, estaba desesperada por terminar y dejar de torturarme. 

✅ Lo único bueno que resalto es que tiene una portada muy bonita y que habían algunas frases que te invitaban a reflexionar.

📌 Conste que me encanta como escribe Elísabet Benavent, pero siento que de los libros que he leído de ella hasta ahora este no le hace justicia.

📌Cuéntenme ¿Han leído este libro? ¿Les ha gustado o no ha sido para ustedes? Los leo!

📚 Por cierto, este ha sido el libro del mes de octubre del #ClubDeLecturaSisters.

17969901689295817;"Valentine’s Day is a hoax 🙃

Prove your love to me everyday of the year
Or this relationship isn’t the real deal
I don’t need an overcrowded restaurant and a box of chocolates
To validate my significance
I need your presence 
Your support 
Your honesty and integrity 
I don’t need a single day where you’re on your best behavior 
Because it’s supposed to mean something
Treat me like a Queen everyday
And I will treat you like my King
We really don’t need to celebrate Valentine’s Day
It feeds commercialism 
And the ego
What a contrived way to celebrate love

True Story: My dad was charming.  He was also abusive.  Every Valentine’s Day he would go all out and by my mom flowers and fine jewelry.  It was kind of like an I’m sorry for shouting like a maniac and throwing things at you most days of the year.  Thanks for putting up with me here’s some fancy jewelry to show you I care. 

Tbh I view this as a cheesy capitalist holiday.  And a great opportunity for those who have something to prove.  As I get older annnnnnd deeper into my spiritual practice, I realize I’m disillusioned by most holidays.  Pretty sure Halloween is the only one that’s holding out.  It’s funny because I used to love celebrating holidays.  As I’ve evolved I realize I really don’t care 🤷‍♀️ Am I the only one?";2023-02-13 17:34:10+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:20.976028+00:00;15;59;en
18000960136577872;"Call me old-fashioned, but I still believe that all of God's laws and principles remain the same- no matter the era or the generation. There's no 'grace message' that you will preach to me that will help me understand how some of His principles and laws should be overlooked in this present age. I'm sorry, but I would never understand such.

One day, about ten years ago, my friend and l planned to hangout after church service on a Sunday. He attended another church so we decided to meet up in an eatery at a central location. He came with a couple of other friends and in no time, we started gisting and getting to know one another. One conversation led to another and then we started talking about singles and relationships. One of the ladies said (in a rather carefree nature) she regularly has sex with her boyfriend and there's no big deal about it. Infact she said she could never date someone who she wasn't going to be intimate with, as it's a prerequisite for a successful relationship. Several questions flooded my young mind.

More recently I had a colleague who had the very same reasoning as this lady. Her own reason totally shocked me, as I never expected her to say those words. She told me that her pastor encouraged his members to get involved intimately with their partners before marrying them. Infact his popular phrase was 'tested okay'.

God's principles and laws remain the same. A sin is a sin. It is very wrong to engage in sexual immorality. Because most people are doing it doesn't make it approved by God. Because your pastor encourages it doesn't mean God isn't frowning at it. Grace doesn't cover sinful living. Let's be clear on this. 

Sex is only for married couples. 
Sex is only for married couples.
Sex is only for married couples.

Because everyone is doing something does not make it right and because no one is doing it doesn't make it wrong.

""But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people.""
Ephesians 5:3 NIV

I remember listening to bug for the first time and right off the bat I thought of marionette. At first I thought it was almost like a sequel or a purple remake of the song lol- I'm obviously not saying they're pretty much the same song, it's much more the verses rather than the chorus. It might just be coincidental bc it's his style of music but there is definitely at least some similarities

Brace yourself 😬 Unpopular opinions abound in this post 🥴

1. If I’m not loving a book, I will stop reading it 😱 I kind of love sharing #litihavequit because I know that for lots of folks the idea of quitting a book is blasphemous 😈 
2. Both of these books are so popular and highly recommended 😱 Both authors are gorgeous writers and had fascinating premises for these books. But both felt very very slow. And I wasn’t craving picking them up 🤷🏻‍♀️ So I quit. I LOVED Hamnet by Maggie O’Farrell, and I liked some of The Marriage Portrait but it felt too slow for me. Her writing is gorgeous and descriptive but it just felt too long. With Babel, I also felt it was too slow-it’s a fascinating premise but I wasn’t invested.
3. I gave both books about 100-125 pages before quitting 🫠 I really wanted to stick with these…but just couldn’t 🤷🏻‍♀️

This was book 3 on yesterday’s post and I gave it a shot, but I’ve now given up on this book twice and I’m not picking it back up. 

I started this book in the fall (when I took this picture, fully expecting to love it), but got bored and put it down for a while. 

This week I tried it on audio, made it 55% and am still bored. I don’t love the writing and don’t care about half the characters.  I found myself not wanting to read out listen to more of it.

In theory, I like that this is a book about books and how they bring us together, but just did not enjoy reading this one.

I have a really hard time DNFing books, but I’m turning over a new leaf, if it’s not bringing me joy, I’m out. 

❓What book have you read that is a bookstagram darling but didn’t work for you? This is my third or fourth in the last few months that I didn’t love.

17907332249367828;"✨BOOK REVIEW✨
Wish You Were Here by Jodi Piccoult
Genre: Contemporary Fiction
Pages: 336
Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️✨ (3.5/5)

I am really struggling with this rating and review, because there were so many things I really enjoyed about this book and so many others I didn’t like 🤷🏻‍♀️

Diana is perfectly on track: she has the perfect job, and the perfect doctor boyfriend who is about to propose on their upcoming trip to the Galapagos. Until COVID-19 hits and her boyfriend is forced to stay home and help in the hospitals, while she reluctantly goes on the trip alone. When she gets to the island, everything is shut down for quarantine and she realizes she has no idea how long she’ll have to stay.

Let me start by saying I am a HUGE fan of Jodi Piccoult and have been since high school. She has written some of my favorite books and I love her writing style, so I was so excited to pick this one up.

I want to leave this review without spoilers as I went in blind and you should too! However if you have read it, check out my Goodreads (link in bio) for my full review.

First of all, it goes without saying that this book is about COVID-19 and the pandemic and it was very hard to read at points. Please know that before you read!

Unfortunately, I was really bored the first half of this book. While it was clear Jodi Piccoult did extensive research, not only about COVID-19, but also about the art industry, at times it felt like I was reading a textbook. There was very little dialogue and mostly pages and pages of in-depth research.

Fortunately, the second half of the book moved faster for me and I really enjoyed Diana’s character arch and where the book went. It was shocking, heartbreaking, and bold and I really appreciated and loved that.

That is why my review is right down the middle, with me slightly liking it more than not. Jodi Piccoult is an incredible writer and this book is no exception, it just fell a bit flat for me.

⭐⭐.5
The Twelve Dates of Christmas, by Jenny Bayliss⁠
👈🏼SYNOPSIS: Swipe left⁠
.⁠
✍🏼REVIEW: I don't actually care if the book was cleverly named after the song because 12 dates was too damn many. Especially when it only takes you 20 pages to actually figure out the ending and then you spend the next 400 pages in a torturous Groundhog Day scenario of dates. I attempted to read this thing not once, not twice, but three times before I finally did it. ⁠
Now, I'm giving it a three because despite being boring, it was cute. I'm a sucker for the holidays in cute British village and honestly I could totally picture this one as a cute Netflix holiday movie and probably enjoy it. And of course you know the ending because what joyful holiday romance book ends with everyone single and miserable?

18012324271349861;"„Shuggie Bain” von Douglas Stuart, übersetzt von Sophie Zeitz

[dieses Buch braucht quasi alle TW die es so gibt]

Es sind die 80er Jahre in Glasgow, das Leben der Arbeiterschicht ist hart und die Unterstützung vom Staat quasi nicht vorhanden. Agnes hat im Leben nur Pech gehabt und versucht den Kopf oben zu halten, doch der Alkohol drängt sie in den Abgrund. Ihre zwei ältesten Kinder Catherine und Leek ziehen rechtzeitig die Reißleine, doch Shuggie ist ihr Jüngster, noch zu klein um zu verstehen und alleine zu überleben. Also tut Shuggie alles in seiner Macht stehende um seiner Mutter zu helfen. Er kümmert sich um sie, versucht sie vom Alkohol fern zu halten und riskiert dafür seine eigene noch intakte Zukunft. Und als wäre das Leben für ihn nicht hart genug, wird er dafür schikaniert nicht dazu zu gehören, nicht wie die anderen Jungs in der Siedlung Bälle zu kicken und sich für Mädchen zu interessieren, vulgär zu reden und mit der ersten Fummelei anzugeben. 

Douglas Stuart schreibt unglaublich liebevoll von einer Mutter, die so viel grausames in ihrem Leben erlebt, dass sie vergisst was glücklich sein bedeutet. Seine Charaktere sind so komplex und fein ausgearbeitet, dass mir die Geschichte so unter die Haut geht, als würde ich ihr selbst mit beiwohnen. Einer Grausamkeit folgt die nächste und der/die Leser*in bekommt nicht eine Verschnaufpause, ein Aufatmen, einen glücklichen Moment um Energie aufzutanken. Was ein genialer Schachzug um einen das Gefühl der absoluten Hilflosigkeit und Hoffnungslosigkeit spüren zu lassen. Aber auch wenn der Autor ganz klar ein überaus talentierter Schriftsteller ist, reicht mir das nicht, um dieses Buch zu lieben. Das was dieses Buch ausmacht, wurde für mich zum Problem, zum Störfaktor. Die Message der Geschichte war schnell klar und ab da drehte sie sich bis kurz vor Ende im Kreis. Es gab kein vor und zurück, kein erkennbares Ziel. Fast wirkt es so, als könne der Autor kein Detail weglassen, keinen Erzählstrang ungeschrieben lassen, kein Ende finden. 500 Seiten Trostlosigkeit sind mir einfach zu viel. Mit Sicherheit das beeindruckendste Buch das ich bis jetzt gelesen habe, aber am Ende des Tages muss Lesen mir Spaß machen.";2021-10-21 07:02:04+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:20.991705+00:00;23;279;de

18333133870034828;"👎MOST DISAPPOINTING BOOKS OF 2022👎

Everyone's sharing their best books list, and my best of 2022 list is coming soon, but in the meantime, I thought I’d reflect on some of the books that let me down the most this year. I love hyping up the books I adored, but sometimes, it’s cathartic to complain about those 1- and 2-star read. 

I’ll repeat what I wrote in the introduction slide here in the caption because it always feels a little scary to post a list like this without a thousand disclaimers. I decided to call this my “most disappointing” list instead of my “worst” list because, for a lot of these books, it was just a mismatch of reader and book. The disappointment exists on a spectrum, so I tried to group these books together in categories that best reflected how they disappointed me. These books weren’t for me, but they might be for you! Don’t let my negativity dissuade you from reading and enjoying these books. (And if any of your favorites are here, I’m sorry. 😔) 

The categories (and books, if you don’t want to swipe through my amateur Canva edit) are…

IT’S NOT YOU, IT’S ME (Books in genres/styles I don’t tend to read often, so my opinions on these books were definitely influenced from the start)
🍑The Southern Book Club’s Guide to Slaying Vampires by Grady Hendrix
🍸Yerba Buena by Nina LaCour

DIDN’T LIVE UP TO THE HYPE (Booksta’s most popular books that were, unfortunately, not for me)
🌠The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue by V.E. Schwab
💛The Spanish Love Deception by Elena Armas

FLAMES…FLAMES ON THE SIDE OF MY FACE (Books I thought were truly terrible)

""The fae abandoned this world to us. And the ones with power rule.""

The two lines written above is what convinced me to read this book. Fae and powers...sign me up! There were things I liked and disliked about Gild but let me just say this book wasn't what I expected at all.

The first scene was just ""ick"" and I wanted to look away. It was disturbing and I almost DNFd it right then. I didn't sign up for an orgy fest. Don't get me wrong I love a good smutty read if it's done tastefully but there was no taste in that scene. I was definitely bothered by King Midas calling his ""concubines"" Saddles, SADDLES! Ridding his saddle! Like blehhh. It just left a bad taste in my mouth. 

As I'm writing this review, I'm racking my brain on what I really liked or even enjoyed about this book. I'm coming up short. Sorry guys. The main character Auren is gilded in gold by King Midas who he calls ""His favored, his precious"" he won't let anyone touch her. This just gives me flashbacks from the movie The Mummy and the concubine Ancksunamun who was covered in paint so the Pharoh can see if anyone touched her. 

Auren WANTS to stay in her cage, and she LOVES King Midas who is essentially her jailor that uses her as his sex slave. Couldn't get over that one either. There's no plot whatsoever. The story didn't even pick up until the last few chapters and then it just suddenly ended. I know Raven Kennedy is setting the reader up for the sequel Glint, but this book was really underwhelming for me. The only interesting characters were Sail and Commander Rip. 

I will end this on a positive note. The story and setting were unique and original. Kennedy set the reader up nicely for the sequel. There's a nice little twist at the end but I'm not sure I'll be rushing to Glint anytime soon. 2.5 stars

Girl Forgotten by Karin Slaughter

A girl with a secret... Longbill Beach, 1982. Emily Vaughn gets ready for prom night, the highlight of any high school experience. But Emily has a secret. And by the end of the evening, she will be dead.
A murder that remains a mystery... Forty years later, Emily's murder remains unsolved. Her friends closed ranks, her family retreated inwards, the community moved on. But all that's about to change.
One final chance to uncover a killer... Andrea Oliver arrives in town with a simple assignment: to protect a judge receiving death threats. But her assignment is a cover. Because, in reality, Andrea is here to find justice for Emily - and to uncover the truth before the killer decides to silence her too...

 Review- I know Karin slaughter is a really popular thriller author, but this is the first book I have read of hers, wow, it took me a whole 28 days to read this… There were so many characters, subplots and cases that it took me a while to get my head round it all. 
Unpopular opinion, incoming… I just found it a struggle to read, and actually a little bit boring when I finally got to the plot twist, I was a bit like… meh 🫣
Saying that I did love the character Emily, who was dead at the beginning of the book, but we got lots of flashbacks, to her thoughts and actions, I really felt for her as she was just a young girl. 
All in all, I don’t think I would pick up another book by this author, but I’m always up for people to change my mind! 

What did you think of this one have you read any others by this author?

17847034817867603;"""You're never ready""🙄🫣🚫

Please stop saying this to people without kids. I understand the sentiment but truly believe it's just a cliche statement that most parents haven't reflected on & I absolutely hated it. I will NEVER say this. 

I don't think you can be ""fully"" ready ever (for anything.) But I absolutely 100% believe you can be ""not ready."" 

You might NEVER be ready because you don't want children. Mental health. Fertility. Loss. Health conditions. Personal choice. Life circumstances. Finances. Literally NO ONE ELSES BUSINESS. 

I have wanted to be a mom since I was a toddler. No joke. When Harry and I got married & the baby questions started- I stood FIRM in my gut feeling that I wasn't ready...yet. Everyone was saying the same thing & I felt so invalidated. 

If this is you... I see you. I feel for you. It's okay 🙏

I am literally SO HAPPY I didn't start trying just because it made sense on other peoples timeline or because my husband was ready. *I was not ready* and then one day, after my OWN process, without one ounce of influence from ANYONE, I was. 

In the depths of the first trimester and being sick every single day--I kept a strong, optimistic mindset. If I had gotten pregnant even 6 months earlier, I do not believe this would have been the case. I made peace with changing our life and habour ZERO resentment for this choice. 

Stop invalidating other people's experience of their unique journey to parenthood or their personal choice to remain childless. If you are excited for your friends and family to have kids- keep it to yourself unless they bring it up. Hold space for them to talk through a life changing decision. (If this was you in my journey, thank you so much 🙏) 

Don't project your experience onto them and PLEASE do not tell them ""you're never ready"" because I guarantee about 100 other people have said this exact phrase. I wish I saw just one person say this, so I'll let that person be me.

I feel like this book gets a lot of undeserved hate. I enjoyed this and I did not see the twist at the end coming at all. This gave me creepy vibes and honestly I couldn’t put it down. Yes some of the characters are maddening, if not all. But honestly some of my favourite thrillers were because of the morally grey characters. If you’ve been putting this off because of the bad press it seems to have acquired but you like the blurb are drawn in by the cover and love creepy, dark academia vibes.

Additional Information: Deadball-P is one of the popular producers on Niconico. He was born on February 23, 1985. Although this popularity is mainly due to the controversial lyrics in his songs. His early works contained blatant sexual expression and were deleted from Niconico when the CD sales for them started. He often re-uploads the removed songs with revised moderate lyrics. He is also a big fan of Yuri and releases several duet songs that he titles as part of his ""yuri"" series. In addition to his love of yuri, He even created his own anthropomorphic character called ""De P"" (Source: Vocaloid Wiki)";2022-04-05 18:49:34+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:24.560674+00:00;13;281;en

In 1939, FDR declared Thursday November 23rd to be Thanksgiving, which happened to be the last Thursday of the month that year. It did not go over well with lots of people as you can see from this example. It didn’t go over well in the proceeding year after. However, OTD in 1941 it became no longer a moot point as FDR signed a bill making it official. Hard to believe that so soon after when Thanksgiving would be held would become the least of FDR and the country at whole’s worries. 

This is either from the Library of Congress or FDR presidential library website.

So why couldn't I love it as much as everyone around me? I have been pondering on this question for weeks now and guess what? I still have no answer.

Not to say I hated it but there were certainly parts which bored me and I yawned. Yes you read that right!

17919350801249274;"🐢 Book Review 🐢

Unpopular opinion alert so buckle up!  I’ve heard several people rave about this book but for me it was…fine.  This book tells the story of Diana who, due to the outbreak of Covid, ends up in the Galapagos. Alone. While her doctor boyfriend is stuck working at the hospital in an all hands on deck situation. 

What I liked:
🐢 The descriptions of Isabella Island, the Galapagos is now squarely at the top of my bucket list
🐢 All of the characters except the main character 
🐢 The concepts of art as a conversation or therapy or whatever it means to you
🐢 The unexpected direction the author takes

Could take or leave:
💊 The main character, gracious she was whiny
💊 This book is set in March 2020 at the height of the pandemic, and I had physical reactions to the memories this invoked. 

Overall, I think the author did a good job describing the state of the world as the pandemic unfurled around us. And the narrator did a really great job! But in general, this one wasn’t for me. However don’t let my opinion dissuade you! 

What’s a book you have an unpopular opinion about, either positive or negative?

17853004361765184;"I loved How Sweet It Is, by Dylan Newton, when I read it last year, and I was so excited to receive the second book in the series from readforeverpub and netgalley. Thank you for the e-copy. This book is out now!

Synopsis:
As a successful book publicist, Imani Lewis works night and day to promote her authors.  It’s her dream job, but she’s become a total workaholic. So when her grandmother invites her to stay for the summer as she recovers from surgery, Imani happily agrees. But being back in the same small town as her one-night stand may not be quite the relaxing break she envisioned… 
Zander Matthews wakes up every day determined to enjoy the present because he knows from his time in the Marines that tomorrow isn’t guaranteed. But he’s never gotten over the beautiful woman who blew through town a year ago, then disappeared. And he doesn’t want to be hurt again. So they agree to a deal: he’ll help Imani fix up her grandmother’s house as long as they stay firmly in the friend zone.
Whether it’s repairing tiles in his ceramics studio, dodging nosy neighbors, or soothing the most obnoxious parrot ever, Zander never fails to make Imani laugh. And soon their friendly banter is turning ever flirtier. But since Imani’s stay is temporary and Zander can’t be tied to anything beyond the most tenuous plans, will she be able to handle it when things get all fired up?

Thoughts - Unfortunately, I didn’t love this one nearly as much as the first book. I didn’t like Imani, and thought she treated Zander kind of crappy. Some of the dialogue was off (weirdly formal?) and there were a few scenes that could’ve been left out (Kate giving birth). That being said, it has a lot of good reviews so maybe it’s just me. I am still looking forward to Ryker’s book!

No Exit by Taylor Adams
⭐️💫 (1.5 stars)

okay, so uh….it’s a no from me🫠 

i really thought i was going to like this book, but i couldn’t get into it at all. i felt like the plot was rushed and predictable, all of the characters were extremely unlikeable, and the narration was all over the place. the author also included some terms and plot points that I think were uncalled for and unnecessary. 

i usually love thrillers with a bit of grit, but I think this one was a little much for me. I’m also not a big fan of gore, so I was pretty uncomfortable while reading it and so I just tried to get through it as quickly as I could. 

for some unknown reason, i can’t stop reading books once i start them. but if I could, I would DNF this one😬 ultimately, this book was just not my cup of tea. the premise was interesting, but i didn’t enjoy how it was executed.

17913153209378545;"What's not to love about this creative and feminist Hindu retelling?! Oh wait... this is awkward... 🫠 #UnpopularOpinion

Kaikeyi by Vaishnavi Patel

To start with the positives... I LOVED learning more about Hindu folklore and Indian culture! Patel did a fantastic job of recasting Kaikeyi as a nuanced woman navigating unforgiving circumstances. I also adored the asexual representation, which added a layer of queerness to this already modern and diverse storytelling. 

That said, it brings me no joy to say that I really struggled to connect with Kaikeyi. Was it because the first person perspective lacked the lyrical descriptions I crave in books? Was it our heroine/villain herself and the way she manipulated those around her? Was it the slow-paced writing style coupled with an excessively chaotic climax? Maybe all of the above. 

Ultimately, I was left wanting more. And, while I didn't actively ""dislike"" this book, I'm disappointed that I didn't have the same rapturous experience as so many others.

Final thoughts: 🤷🏻‍♀️ It's not you, it's me. 

Thank you to netgalley and Redhook Books for an advanced copy of this read. Also thank you to meggatzabookclub for organizing a the.storygraph buddy read/chat and letting me vent a bit even tho she loved it!

With a house you view on average 12 before you buy & you're very picky with what you want to get out of your money.

So why should you not be the same when you're planning & paying for a wedding?

When meeting venues & suppliers - ask as many questions as possible, look at the details, create priority lists, haggle, and don't just settle for the first option!

You have a right to be picky. 

For our wedding we are creating a list of wants and putting them in order of priority. Things at the top of this list are not for compromising, the further down the list we are happy to compromise on.

I feel like I need to clarify here too:
I am absolutely not condoning being rude and demanding - there is no need for more ""bridezillas"".

Just go into the process knowing what you want - and look around enough to know if you can afford that and what you are happy to compromise on.
Don't settle for the rip off venue and shitty food, you'll just feel upset after.

Griechische Mythologie trifft auf eine Art Liebesroman

Nach fast einem Jahr ungelesen auf meinem SuB wollte ich es nun doch mal zur Hand nehmen. Gehyped von all den positiven Rezensionen gekauft und dann aufgrund von Büchern, welche mir mehr zugesagt haben, doch in Vergessenheit geraten. Eventuell auch wegen der Befürchtung, dass das Buch dem Hype nicht standhalten kann. Und was soll ich sagen? Für mich war das auch so.
Die Geschichte von Patroklos und Achill wird zart und langsam vor sich herkriechend beschrieben, der für mich gute und atmosphärische Spannungsbogen beginnt erst ca 60 Seiten vor Schluss. Wäre das komplette Buch im Stil der letzten 60 Seiten geschrieben, wäre es ein Highlight gewesen.
So war es eher trist und langatmig. Einfach nicht das, was ich erwartet habe.

Es ist eine solide Geschichte, welche man sich durchlesen kann, gehört für mich jedoch eher zu der Kategorie „für Zwischendurch“. Leider hat es einfach nicht meinen Geschmack getroffen.

A popular book that annoyed you?

'The Song of Achilles' by Madeline Miller🍂

Tell me you won't curse me under your breath after reading this review, I wanted to write an appreciating review for TSOA, I wanted to write how much Miller impressed me with her spectacular writing style and how colossal the settings are, I wished to place Achilles on the top of Circe in my favorite characters list, but I couldn't. This book hugely disappointed me.

The initial chapters were so good, I absolutely adored Patroclus and his fragility, Achilles and his prowess, but everything vanished gradually. I was supposed to love Achilles, but I loathed his demeanor.

Achilles' selfishness, indifference and everything made me get enraged towards him. My heart grieved for Patroclus, but I didn't love him either. 
The relationship between Achilles and Patroclus didn't make sense to me at all!!! I didn't feel anything in the end. I was relieved to know that their relationship ended, it was suffocating both of them throughly.

If you've read my review of Circe, you all would have known how much I enjoyed reading the book, every line moved me, I tried hard not to compare Circe and TSOA, but the exasperating dispositions of all the characters here, made me constantly wonder how much I I loved Circe and how much I dislike TSOA. 

If you want me to name the books and the characters in the books that annoyed me to the core, I would write TSOA on the top of the list.

Also, Don't get me started on Thetis and Agememnon. AARGHHH!

Did this book break my heart? I was waiting for that chapter to move me, to break my heart, instead, it made me feel relieved that I finished reading the exasperating characters I've encountered so far.";2021-09-15 12:16:09+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:26.791363+00:00;81;1012;en

⭐️⭐️
I’ve finally accepted that Ishiguro just isn’t for me. Blasphemy, I know. I enjoyed The Remains of the Day in its quiet beauty, but the rest of his works have been just a miss for me. Klara and the Sun was particularly boring and vague. I kept reading thinking “This is gonna get good soon. Something interesting is going to happen.” But nothing happened. Like the big “secret” Josie’s parents were keeping from her was not a surprise. It was obvious. Shallow characters making vague sweeping statements about love and an AI who worships the sun. The AI was supposed to be really smart and clever, but didn’t realize that there are many machines causing pollution, not just one machine that it saw one time. I get that there’s an overarching theme about climate change and how humans, in their own way, are “solar powered” like Klara (just not as directly), but the climate change part didn’t really go anywhere? I don’t know how to explain this well, but the characters just felt forgettable. It felt like a children’s story when I assumed it would be adult literary fiction. I really wish I could see and feel the things people see and feel when they read Ishiguro. 😭

This was one of those that I had really high (too high) expectations for. I wanted it to wow me from page 1. I wanted to love everything about it as soon as I started it... but it didn't do it for me. I spent a majority of the time waiting for the other shoe to drop. Waiting for me to finally have that aha! moment. And it came too late. 

Reading this made me feel dumb, too. Like I wasn't capable of understanding why it's so loved. Which is always a poopy feeling. But... WE DON'T ALL READ BOOKS THE SAME (she reinforces to herself).

First book of 2023, though. So there's that. Cheers!

❓ What new release are you looking forward to?

❗ Part of Your World, Something Wilder, Bloodmarked and The Bodyguard are the first that pop into my mind.

Contemporary Romance
Pub day: TOMORROW! (March 1st 2022)
Third person past tense, multiple POVs

👉 Blurb on the last slide

This was a challenging but good read. Listening felt like having an anxiety attack at times. To me this means that the author and the narrator did a great job of conveying authentic feelings. 

👍
+ The anxiety rep in this book is very well done! It covers grief, panic attacks, therapy, in a way that feels authentic.
+ Their romance is a cute slow burn romance. I loved that Dan loves her for all the right reasons, because of how smart and successful she is.
+ I liked that both Harper and Dan had unique back stories that drove their insecurities and motivations. It was almost tragic seeing Harper work herself to the bone because of these, but it still was relatable and real.
+ I loved Harper's friend group. They were there for her, they loved her, they nudged her in the right direction. And they added a good amount of comic relief. 

👎
- The main character becomes less and less likeable throughout the book. I understand her overwhelming anxiety is causing her to push others away, but the way she does this is so incredibly unacceptable. I don't care what you're going through, you don't mock others' trauma.
- I didn't like the implication that you can't have success at work and have a relationship. Harper has been maintaining close friendships throughout her school career but somehow being in a relationship makes her completely lose herself? It didn't make any sense to me considering how much she values her success.
- Dan is one-note throughout the novel, no matter what Harper does he's never offended nor frustrated. Someone who gives you no pushback and just goes along with whatever you want will not make for a good relationship partner. 

🎧 There was a separate narrator for each MC. Especially the narrator for Harper was fantastic.

-
We all have tropes in books we love and hate. Maybe you pick up a certain book just because you know it features a trope you love. Or maybe a good book is ruined by the inclusion of a trope you hate. 
-
Here are some of the tropes that I dislike, avoid, and even despise in books. What tropes do you dislike? 
-
*disclaimer: no shade to anyone who likes these, we all have our opinions, and you should read what you enjoy! 👍🏻
-
🚫PREGNANCY TROPE—not a fan in general, and I’ve noticed that it seems like when authors don’t know what to do with coupled characters they just make them have a kid. Like, there are other ways for a relationship to progress!

🚫MC LOSES THEIR POWERS AT THE END—this just bums me out lol 

🚫MISCOMMUNICATION TROPE—so this one can work, but I get annoyed when a given central conflict could literally be resolved in a single conversation

🚫BARE MINIMUM BILLY—when emphasis is put on how great a male character is because he did the bare minimum/has basic decency. A common one is “wow the girl was drunk but he didn’t take advantage of her, how saintly”

🚫NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS GIRL—It’s one thing if you’re not like other girls because, say, you are secretly a witch, but it’s another to put down femininity and other women

🚫INNOCENT VIRGIN TROPE—in the realm of the not like other girls trope, this is when a female character is shown to be better than other girls, particularly in the eyes of male characters, because she has remained ‘untouched’

🚫THE ALCOHOLIC DETECTIVE—yes, I understand, the detective main character has seen terrible things, but they don’t ALL have to be written as people barely functioning in most ways but somehow still able to not only keep their job, but also solve complex mysteries. It’s not always alcohol, but a variety of vices/behaviors. Give me a self-aware sleuth who goes to therapy. It’s still interesting, I promise. 

🚫IT WAS ALL A DREAM TROPE—need I say more?

NOTE: Since this background picture is in the MV of the mentioned song it has to be treated like official art

so the song bakuromu by hiiragi kirai got taken down on youtube and niconico (and maybe bilibili I'm unsure) because of controversy over the mv, if I'm correct the accusation was that kanda you (the illustrator of the mv) traced or copied woomas art, now I think this is a bit dumb because there was no evidence I could find other than a few youtube comments claiming that wooma herself confirmed it which I believe is false and on hiiragi kirais twitter a statement was posted that claimed kanda you wasn't at fault, I think this all started because hk usually works with wooma on mvs and I will admit kanda and wooma both have similar styles and kanda is significantly less popular than wooma but I honestly think that kanda was just trying to make the mv similar to the styles in hks other videos and the mv shouldn't have been deleted cuz it was such a banger

Agree or Disagree? Write down in the comments

Admin thoughts: I actually have a music rec with a song where Kanda You is the illust and I really like the song so yeah

17919169997169520;"#unpopularopinion Es gibt in der #bookstagramcommunity Bücher, die einen gewissen Hype erfahren. In der Vorweihnachtszeit war es nach meinem Eindruck ""Allein"" von Daniel Schreiber. Und manchmal ist es auch schön, sich von diesem Hype anstecken zu lassen und Teil eines großen Ganzen zu sein. Aber was, wenn ich als Bloggerin, entgegen der gefühlt 99,9 % positiven Rezensionen, das Buch einfach nicht mögen kann? Soll ich trotzdem darüber sprechen und das Buch rezensieren? Diese Frage habe ich mir bei ""Allein"" gestellt und hier folgt nach einigen Gesprächen mit Luise und anderen Blogger:innen, die mich in meiner Meinung bestärkt haben, meine *unpopular opinion*: Mein vermutetes Neujahreshighlight ist wohl eher ein Flop geworden. Und dabei habe ich mich sehr auf das Essay gefreut. Gefreut auf das Alleinsein in den ersten Tagen des neuen Jahres, ohne viele Verabredungen und mit einem Buch, dass mich auch literarisch in das Alleinsein entführt. Zugegebenermaßen war meine Erwartungshaltung aufgrund der vielen positiven Meinungen und des Spiegelbestseller-Stickers hoch. Davon abgesehen ist da natürlich auch noch die Vorstellung, dass mir das Alleinsein erklärt wird. Bekommen habe ich ein Buch voll mit Namen von Philosoph:innen, Psycholog:innen, Wissenschaftler:innen und zum Teil nur die Vornamen, von mit dem Autor bekannten Autor:innen die sich alle in einer bestimmten Art und Weise schon mal Gedanken zum Alleinsein gemacht haben. Das Ganze verschachtelt in Sätze, die mir zum Teil mit Fremdwörtern und vom allgemein sprachlichen Ausdruck her zu kompliziert erschienen, sodass ich viele Sätze mehrmals gelesen oder übersprungen habe. Inhaltlich bildet es wohl eine Blase von privilegierten, in Großstädten lebenden Ende 20 bis Mitte 40-jährigen-Intellektuelle ab, zu der ich mich zwar gezählt hätte, aber aus der ich mich auf einmal ausgeschlossen fühlte. Inhaltlich habe ich, obwohl es mit Sicherheit voll von Fakten war, nichts mitgenommen über das wirkliche Leben des Alleinseins. Das hat mich insgesamt eher frustriert zurückgelassen. Ich wünsche mir gerade sehr einen vom Ansatz her ähnliches Buch aber mit weniger Namedropping und schönen Sätzen - habt ihr Empfehlungen?

The Spanish Love Deception by Elena Armas
⭐️⭐️⭐️💫

🚨Semi-unpopular opinion alert

The Spanish Love Deception is another one of those books that has been all over Instagram and TikTok, and I honestly couldn’t wait to read it! However, I’ve been putting off writing this review because I’m simply so torn on how to rate it, and I have conflicting feelings about it. 

If someone were to simply ask “did you enjoy the book?” then my answer is absolutely! There were many things I absolutely loved. Of course the first thing would be Aaron Blackford. Aaron Blackford is one of those quintessential book boyfriends. Seriously *chef’s kiss*. I also loved Lina’s character. She was strong, independent, maybe a little oblivious, but definitely fun to read. The dynamic between her family was entertaining and honestly relatable. I think we all have at least some relatives similar to Lina’s. 
 
Despite loving all of those things, I just found the book too long and way way too much of a slow burn. Don’t get me wrong, I love a good slow burn romance. There is nothing like that build up to seeing two characters come together. Unfortunately, in this case, it took so long that I started to lose interest. Maybe I’m just an impatient person, but I found myself quickly looking ahead to see how much longer I was going to have to wait. I never do that. When I finished the book, I was left wanting more of Lina and Aaron. Even though I had nearly 500 pages of them, I didn’t get enough of them as an official couple.

Although I would have liked to see a few adjustments, I’m still impressed this is a debut novel. Elena Armas has a gift for creating some amazing characters and I’m excited to see and read what she comes up with for future books.

2🌟🌟

This book was such a disappointment!! Babel & Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow both lived up to their hype but this one really fell short for me. 

It's slightly out of my regular genre but I've enjoyed other titles that I would consider similar. 

The characters annoyed me (so I do admit I was invested in them) but it was the complete lack of plot that made it very nearly a DNF. I wanted to hear more from Eleanor, and even sometimes more from Zoe. 

Looking at goodreads reviews it appears I'm not alone but I know this is likely to be an unpopular review 😅";2023-03-04 12:19:21+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:29.564701+00:00;1;13;en

17926567450992535;"Books are coins, they have two sides. They exist first in our minds. Writing it is tossing the coin. Reading it is also tossing the coin. You flip & there it is: the book in your hands that was once an idea. Execution, language, grammar are its back side. Where the sentences are. The story.

Bridging the times of philosophers & their philosophies & the times we live in; like the times of Rumi & Shams Tabrizi & of Ella.

Becoming portals of time.

Between its covers—front & back—there is an entry & an exit; & I'm not sure I exit with the same energy I entered it with.

Before The Forty Rules-- was a story, it was a promise. Before I knew that Ella would discover love from a book & that Aziz would write it & that they'll reach one another through Sufism & mysticism & that inside it, Rumi will find Shams like Ella finds Aziz. Before I read it.

Bear with me a little longer? You see, it must be one of these things—coins, bridges, covers, portals or anything with two sides, like the story itself— because I share a liking for one & an aversion for the other, especially its odd aftertaste. I am divided between the two & it's the same thing that divides religion & spirituality that divides me.

""Believers are each other's mirrors""

But belief is a thing that shivers or simply fades. Perhaps even in its journey, from its source to its reciever. It stammers from the story of Rumi's enlightenment to Ella's.

Barring a few events in life, it is up to us to assign meaning to what we live. It is an exceptionally human thing. But it can also be futile sometimes. Unnecessary. Dragged. Forced. I'm sad to say but that is what the story felt like at multiple points.

Balance is the humanity of life; even though we exist exclusively in its imbalance. Pushed more than pulled. With uneven strings & uncut ends. I'm sad to say but that is also what the story felt like, despite its search for the opposite: weak & hesitant, despite being almost too loud in its anticipation of stability & linearity. Uneventful. No fireworks.

Be that as it may, I also admire it in parts. The first being the starting of every chapter with the auspicious letter B, like this caption does.

17924439674634986;"1/12/23 Journal Entry Part 1:
.
Navigating my healthy lifestyle, changes and body positivity has been a very tricky thing. 
.
Before I started my journey, I was at the best place I had ever been mentally. Loving myself just as I was. The main reason I started this journey, had nothing to do with my looks, and everything to do with my quality of life. I want to children, with PCOS that was going to be difficult as I only had 2 to 3 cycles a year. I wanted to be able to be around for my children’s children and experience the birth of their children as well. 

I wanted to be able to have the energy to do things and make memories not just let life passed me by. 

As I started my journey, it brought up so many insecurities. I had buried like flying on a plane and being too big for the seat and needing a seatbelt extender. Giving up trips to Disney World, because I’d be in too much pain and too tired. Or even back in high school when my stepmom put me on the cabbage soup diet (y’all remember that one?). I sat there crying over my soup as she did my hair for musical I was in. All these emotions creeped back in.

But I have learned so much in recent years. Knowledge really is power. 

It was not my fault that I couldn’t resist unhealthy foods growing up. PCOS actually plays a huge role in your cravings and appetite and your inability to resist food. And they are literally engineered to make you eat too much.

It was not my fault that I never felt full. My hormones were so out of whack that I wasn’t producing enough leptin to tell my body to stop eating. 

It wasn’t the doctors fault either. Yes the doctors blaming my weight for everything gave me a complex but they didn’t know any better. PCOS was not and still is not a well known syndrome. They made a clinical guess and they were wrong and that’s OK . I have survived and have learned so much from their mistake. I do my own research now because I know they are taught to Band-Aid symptoms not fix the problem.

It’s no one’s fault that I lived most of my life in my own personal hell. Not knowing how to fix it but trying all the same. It happened. I overcame. I am moving on.

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️

When a young huntress, Feyre, kills a wolf in the woods she has no idea how much her life is going to change. That evening a terrifying beast comes to her family’s home for retribution. This is where Feyre is dragged from her home to the treacherous Fae Lands. Feyre quickly realizes that her captor is not only a Fae but High Fae. The longer she spends with Tamlin, her feelings change for him. After all he isn’t a terrifying beast all the time, and he is just fighting for his lands which are under an ancient & wicked shadow. Will Feyre find a way to save the magical lands and Tamlin? Or will she have to choose between the two? 

Entertainment: I will say I was slightly entertained by this book. I’m not the biggest fantasy reader but I was very intrigued because everyone I know has been telling me to read it. I will say I don’t think it quite lived up to the hype. 

Plot: The plot is truly what kept me reading. It has a very beauty and the beast feel to it with a sprinkle of twilight. I love both of those stories hence why I liked the plot of this one so much. 

Characters: I did like the characters I just wish this story was more character driven. I felt like character development wasn’t super strong in this book. I did like the relationships between Feyre, Tamlin, Rhysand, and Lucien. 

Writing style: Not the best in my opinion. Possibly because I just wasn’t super entertained, but things got confusing. Reminds me a little bit of Stephanie Meyer, author of the Twilight series…

Finished product: I did not necessarily like the layout of this book. But I think it’s because we don’t get many perspectives and I have come to really enjoy that in books that I read. 

Okay so obviously I am the unpopular opinion that this book wasn’t great but I am told to give the second one a shot. So I plan on doing that to give this series one last shot!

Ohi ohi, è arrivato il momento 😰😬. 
Vorrei poter fuggire da questo mio obbligo morale che mi spinge,  a parte tutto, a parlarvi di questo libro. 

Per me sarebbe molto più semplice potermela svignare e non ammettere che non mi è piaciuto moltissimo.  Il mio è un snì. 

Di Delitto e Castigo come tutti i classiconi che avete letto e studiato,  trovate talmente tanto materiale in rete e un pò ovunque che sicuramente non avrete bisogno di sapere nulla riguardo trama, analisi del testo ecc. ecc. 

Penso sia più utile il mio umile parere personale. 

Partiamo dalla scrittura.
Dimenticatevi il Conte di Montecristo, Via col vento ecc. 
Questo è un classico doc. 
Con tutte quelle prerogative che ci aspettiamo e che temiamo. 
Voluminoso, Ostico ( giusto un pò ) , Noiosetto q.b., Introspettivo (in abbondanza), non molto scorrevole e ahimè i personaggi sono la parte dolente. 
Sono tanti e quasi tutti i  personaggi oltre ad avere nomi lunghissimi ( che si assomigliano tutti) sono composti da tre parole e inoltre hanno almeno  due soprannomi ciascuno.
Vi farà frullare la testa. 

Riguardo alla scorrevolezza non dimentichiamoci che la letteratura russa è famosa per non essere così fluida, diciamo che leggere Delitto e Castigo non è proprio una passeggiata. 

È anche vero però, che siamo tutti un pò preparati e anch'io avevo preventivato questo aspetto quando ho deciso di affrontarlo. 

Probabilmente il mio errore è stato sceglierlo come lettura dopo-lavoro. Anche no. Molto meglio sarebbe stato leggerlo in vacanza, con più tempo a disposizione. 

Ma.....c'e un ma che è positivo. 
È verò, mi avrà fatto impazzire un pochino però devo dire che la prima metà mi aveva incantata, l'ho letta in soli due giorni ( grazie al ponte del 1 novembre). La storia maledetta, i delitti mi avevano rapita. Inoltre ho apprezzato molto la polifonia  e la sfaccettatura delle ideologie rappresentate dall'autore. 

Nella parte centrale invece ho accusato MOLTISSIMO, tutte le riflessioni filosofiche hanno pesato gravemente. Verso le ultime 100 pagine....

18043332130409342;"I want my kids to fail 
Unpopular opinion, I know 

Trust me this isn’t how I’ve always been…
I can be quite competitive, I mean I grew up with our family means decided by winning and losing #racehorses if you don’t win your losing 

And of course I want them to win and be successful 

But when we fail, when we lose 
Is ultimately when we learn how to live and how to love and be some successful isn’t it?

If they don’t get knocked down how will they know how to get back up 

If they don’t lose how will they know what to continue to practice or how or where to make adjustments 

If they don’t get defeated how will they know how to love themselves through the hard times 

If they don’t fail how will they build the grit and tenacity within to come back stronger, smarter, better 

I want them to have fun in the exploration of the game called life where there are no participation ribbons and your success doesn’t come from how many wins you have but how many “failures” you overcame and used as stepping stones and learning opportunities to create their own success 

I want them to be able to say “yep the ship is sinking but it’s ok I know how to swim” kind of attitude. 

I don’t want them to not try something because they think they can’t win or to quit when they don’t.

I want them to explore and engage in the activities they love and enjoy them

I want their successes not to be defined by a winning record but by their character of who they are whether they win, lose, succeed or fail

Overcoming the losses, enjoying the wins, all of that will offer them their own most beautiful success story 

So here I encourage mistakes, losses, heartbreak. Even though it’s really freaking hard sometimes ❤️

They deserve to be able to choose who they have in their life. They deserve to be able to choose who they share their peace with.

They deserve to be able to make the exact choices their body feels are right, in order to preserve and keep themselves, their nervous system, and their inner children safe. 

You don’t have to understand it to accept it. My message to anyone who may have a difficult time in understanding is to gently remind them that this did not happen overnight. All roads lead to Rome. Behind the distance or estrangement is an immense amount of history and events that likely involved hurt, betrayal, shame, and fear.

17972097871862503;"I’ve been sitting on this review for a few days and I’m still so conflicted in terms of my thoughts on this book. On the one hand I read it in 24 hours (which is positively unheard of for me these days) but on the other hand, unpopular opinion here, I’m really not sure that I liked it. 

CoHo’s books have an unputdownable quality to them and this was certainly no exception but I didn’t have the emotional satisfaction I normally feel at the end of one of her books (after my heart has been ripped out and then put back together) Here I was just left feeling very sad and very caught up in my own thoughts.

This is a heavy book, and not a read that should be undertaken lightly. I feel a book such as this one should come with content warnings as oh there were just so many of them (domestic violence, rape, PTSD, homelessness to name a few).

While I really appreciated how personal a book this was for Hoover to write (the author’s note at the end explains this) and I did feel like Lily’s perspective was very well written and her internal struggle was 100% believable, I also felt like there were some parts of the book which just didn’t work. 

In particular I really disliked the PTSD aspect of the story, and felt it was not handled well at all. It should have been an opportunity to better explain PTSD to readers but instead it felt that it was written in solely as an ‘excuse’ for a characters deplorable behaviour which is a disservice to people suffering from PTSD and that left me feeling very uncomfortable.

I also didn’t believe in the ending. CoHo’s books usually tie things up nicely in a bow and while normally I’m okay with that, here it just felt wrong and not realistic, and the ending really bothered me.

I will likely still read It Starts With Us (mostly because I’ve already bought it) but I’ll be honest, I’m not sure that I’m actually looking forward to it now 🥴

What was the last book you felt torn about?";2022-10-27 14:39:49+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:29.580321+00:00;19;0;en
17983028473526722;"Oh my, I will just dive right in and tell you that I was so disappointed in this book, Something Wilder by Christina Lauren. It is probably an unpopular opinion, but it is one I am sticking with.
⠀
 I actually checked the front cover while I was reading to make sure it was actually written by one of my favorite writing duos. It just didn’t have the same energy, the same witty banter I love, or any of the quirks I find endearing in some of their characters.
⠀
As a romance with some adventure thrown in, a treasure hunt is always exciting, it is good. It is well written, and if I hadn’t been expecting all the things I have loved about their books, I would probably have enjoyed it. However, I really missed that spark and joy I get from reading their other books.
⠀
I am not telling you not to read it, just go into it for the adventure, the little twist, and the second chance romance. The authors’ note said that they wanted to write something different, to travel to an amazing location in the US at a time when we were limited on any travel or adventure because of COVID. I think they did achieve that goal. It did make me want to saddle up and hunt for gold.

OPINIÓN PERSONAL 
El tema del que trata el libro no es fácil y personalmente creo que hay muchos momentos del libro en el que está muy bien llevado. Sin embargo, la ejecución final y el desenlace lo estropean mucho (según mi opinión) y consigue que mis impresión, la sensación al cerrar el libro sea bastante amarga. 
Incluso unos días después de haber terminado el libro aún no tengo claro si me ha gustado o no. 

Hay cosas que me han molestado durante la lectura, como el insta-love de Ryle, las referencias al pijama de médico (que parece el traje de un superhéroe y concede a su dueño la capacidad de borrar la mente de la protagonista), cosas que más o menos puedo pasar por alto y que ya he leído en otros libros, pero, PERO (y aquí viene un spoiler) no puedo pasar por alto que se blanquee la actitud de un maltratador, que le permitas vivir contigo los últimos meses de embarazo, que te quedes tan tranquila compartiendo una custodia porque estas convencida de que va a ser un buen padre. NO. NO. NO. Y NO. Por ahí no paso y creo que estropea todo lo positivo (mucho o poco) que pudiese tener el libro hasta ese momento. No es ese el mensaje y la conclusión final que me apetece recibir de un libro. 

Lamento que la fortaleza de Lily quede opacada por esa desiciôn y lamento que la historia de Atlas quede tan en segundo plano, ya que me parecía muy interesante.

The Silmarillion was the book that had been on my TBR the longest - over 10 years! - so it feels good to have finally finished it. I’m glad I’ve read it now, if only because it’s interesting to see how Tolkien viewed his world’s history. 

I enjoyed Feanor’s drama, the tales of Beren and Luthien, and Turin Turambar, but there was also a lot that I found less easy to get into. This isn’t an adventure story like The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings, it’s more like a history or religious allegory. I’ve read The Hobbit and LOTR several times but I don’t think I’ll be rereading this one! 

Reading along with Mary Clay Watt and tolkienaboutpod made this a lot more entertaining and helped when I got lost! Sometimes I would read the chapter just so I could listen to that week’s podcast - yay discipline! 🤣 it definitely made what would have been a slog more manageable! 

By the way, if you’re after some festive Tolkien goodness, Mary Clay has released an episode on Tolkien’s Letters from Father Christmas that is just the perfect, cosy listen 🎅🏻

18089433436315469;"Pack up the Moon by Kristan Higgins

[ ⭐️ ⭐️ ✨ ]

My interest: Shoot for the 🌙, went down to 🌎

Overall I was disappointed. I know I’m in the minority - it could’ve been an amazing story but I personally found that it fell flat! This premise has been done before with stronger execution.

▫️My little irk: “Honey” was utilized in character dialogues *over 80 times*

▫️I ended up reading for the sake of reading so I know I won’t recommend it/ remember the book later.

▫️Chapter 1 & 2 hits you as a reader and you’re drawn in. I was totally hooked from that thinking I will be an emotional wreck with this book! However from then on it dragged, providing no complexities to the story - I didn’t feel any emotions afterwards. The last two chapters brought my attention back and invoked a bit of emotion but… of course it would as it was describing the end. 

▫️It was very repetitive too. I feel like it would’ve been more beneficial to go chronologically through all the stages because there was so much reiteration of the same moments, the same points. It needed editing.

▫️It was predictable, including the ending

▫️Some of the letter decisions were a bit odd and forced considering the timeline. There was one that was such a random prompt considering the history, and just unnecessary.

▫️The characters lacked dimension. Some weren’t needed at all. The relationship itself I found to be sappy and unrealistic. Lauren was portrayed as perfect throughout the journey as well.

18013730254473393;"🔴Reseña de La chica de nieve, de Javier Castillo (1,5/5 ✴️)🔴
.
.
.
.
📚 Sinopsis: una niña 3 años, Kiera, desaparece en la cabalgata de Acción de Gracias. Después de varios años los padres empiezan a recibir esporádicamente cintas de VHS donde aparece la niña. 
.
.
.
.
.
.
🧐 Opinión personal: 
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
✅ El principio me gustó, creía que podía ser interesante ya que inicia con la desaparición de la niña a las pocas páginas. 
.
.
.
.
.
❌ Creo que es un libro para personas a las que no les gusta este género o al menos no están acostumbradas a leerlo. La trama se deshilacha en demasiados puntos y muchas ""pistas"" se pierden sin sentido. Me parecía estar viendo la típica película de Antena 3 de domingo por la tarde 😂. 
.
.
.
.
❌ Es el segundo libro que leo de este autor y creo que va a ser el último. Me parece que está excesivamente sobrevalorado ya que sus tramas no son nada del otro mundo y su forma de escribir es bastante básica.  Este libro en concreto me ha parecido el típico que se escribe tras presión editorial y no se piensa demasiado. 
.
.
.
.
❌ Considero que se incluyen demasiados temas delicados simplemente para generar morbo. 
.
.

.
.
.
.
.
❌ Muy lineal, cuando me ha mantenido enganchada en ningún momento y me ha costado bastante terminarlo. 
.
.
.
.
.
🤓 ¿Lo recomiendo? : No recomendaría este libro a nadie que quiera leer un buen thriller o novela policíaca y disfrute con este género. Creo que es similar a libros del estilo La chica del tren por lo que puede gustarle a la gente que disfrute ese estilo de lectura.

This client came to me for hair extensions and they looked BEAUTIFUL … then the pandemic hit and the world shut down. We ended up removing her hair extensions and she expressed to me she wanted to try and get her natural hair to be as long as thick as possible. I gave her some recommendations and this picture shows her hair growth over the past 3 years. Curious to know what I told her?

• Color your hair darker - being blonde was not helping her situation. Her hair was too fragile to withstand the lightening process.
• Get quarterly haircuts. Your hair needs to be cut every 3-4 months to remove the split ends which will encourage your hair to grow. 
• NO HEAT. If you must heat style your hair, keep it to once a week, use a heat protectant and keep your hot tools below 365°
• Be gentle with your hair! When brushing start at the bottom and work your way up towards your roots.
Extra Credit: Give your self a scalp massage daily with a high quality rosemary oil. Place a few drops on your fingertips and stimulate those follicles! 😊😊

Also fun fact, before they were a group, the members of BTS were backup dancers for SeeU's hologram during a stage performance she had with the Kpop group GLAM. That makes SeeU BTS' sunbae (Korean equivalent of senpai).

My Big Fat Fabulous Fling
Author: Lyndsey Gallagher

Rating:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.💫

Notes: I received a copy of this book as an advanced reader, but all thoughts and opinions are my own. This is book 2 in the series and although it can be read as a standalone, I’d highly recommend reading book 1, My Big Fat Fabulous Christmas, first. 

What I Liked:
✈️ I have been anticipating a book with Chloe and Jayden ever since they both appeared on page in Book 1 of this series. They did not disappoint!

✈️This book is 🥵. Possibly spicer than book one!

✈️This book was more emotional than you might expect. It started out enemies to lovers who make an agreement to have a fling. Somewhere along the line it flipped to be softer and their interactions were more meaningful. 

What I Didn’t Like:
✈️ Halfway through the book I was screaming at them both to stop and talk to each other. I’m not a huge fan of the miscommunication trope, but it didn’t detract from the story…just irked me a bit that’s all. 

✈️I don’t like an accidental baby which does happen at one point in this book. Another trope I’m not a fan of, but I still loved this regardless. 

Final Thoughts: 
✈️ The saddest thing about reading this in advance is knowing there is a third book in the series I now have to wait for. Hopefully not too long though!

18031141420452189;"Unpopular opinion: ⁠
⁠
It’s really trending to photograph couples, families and future moms being serious, not smiling, staring straight into the camera or, on the contrary, looking away as the photographer wasn't there. This is still big in the fashion industry and has somehow managed to become a trend in family photography. ⁠
I think this has a lot to do with the way the photographer wants to create photos that look just like the ones in his instagram feed, so he designs this image in his head and projects it on the people he’s shooting. This never takes into account people's wants and needs and has an aesthetic value, but never a documentary one. So listen up, connect and try to see people for who they are. ⁠

So now once loved characters like genderbends, haku, zatsune miku etc. are barely recognized anymore, talkloids are not popular anymore, people do not randomly roleplay as characters anymore and many people lowkey put themselves over others because they do not engage in the ""cringe"". Maybe this is also just my subjective view, maybe i'm wrong, maybe people still have as much fun, but I just feel like back in 2016-18 engaging in the fandom was a lot more fun for me at least.

Agree or Disagree? Write down in the comments

Admin thoughts: Fanloids used to be popular in the early days because of the lack of characters. In 2010 only 25 Vocaloids existed plus Teto, Defoko, Momo, Ritsu and Iku were the only notable non-Vocaloids (and even their popularity couldn't be compared to guys like Eleanor or KAFU today). So the fandom wanted more characters to mess around with. Today there are hundreads of characters so ofc their popularity would fall

I really loved the last house on needless street. So i really really wanted to love this. I wanted the same mind blowing experience and this wasn’t quite it

It was strange and twisted like NS. But not quite as epic. I found it to be confusing without the pay off of NS where everything came together in that one.. i still have no clue what was happening in the middle and I’m just going to leave those parts there. There was just a bit too much going on that it got muddled for me. 

The similar names or same names for a separate thing had me scratching my head.. just confused. 🤷🏻‍♀️ some bits could have just been left out. 

There’s quite a bit to unpack here and i feel like most of it comes out in the end that could really have summed things up earlier. 

This wasn’t at all an epic read. I did enjoy it tho... i think. Just not as much as i had hoped. Another wild story tho! 

Thank you tornightfire for the opportunity to read this one!

Hank’s Mom’s Review 
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
The Lincoln Highway is one of those books meant to be savored with every turn of the page. The characters are all perfectly imperfect and doing the best with what they have. You want to dislike a few of them, but then their redeeming values shine through and remind you that we are all only human. The backstory of each character was my favorite part and helped bring their adventure together full circle. Overall, it’s a reminder that life is not black and white. It’s a rainbow of colors that make each of us who we are. 

……………………………………………………………………………….

Reposting Smokey’s Mom’s (My Review)
The Lincoln Highway was the longest highway 
⭐️⭐️⭐️

This was my final read of 2022. Unpopular opinion… I didn’t love The Lincoln Highway. It makes me super sad, because it’s my fabulous friend Tami’s (Hank’s mom’s) favorite book EVER! 

The Lincoln Highway has serious Huckleberry Finn and This Tender Land vibes! 🏔 

After being released from a juvenile work camp, Emmitt (18), his little brother Billy (8), and two mischievous friends Emmett met at camp begin the adventure of a lifetime. Set across the US on the Lincoln Highway, Emmett and company disagree between traveling to California and New York. You will never guess where they end up and who they will meet…. Oh what mischievous they get into.

The Lincoln Highway was much longer than necessary, very slow and hard to follow at times. But, it ended with a bang.

18250434607157520;"Partiamo con il presupposto che per me è difficilissimo scrivere una recensione per questo libro. Per me è un no, ma non un no severo e disgustato, possiamo definirlo come un ""non ancora"". Sono partita con basse aspettative e quindi non sono scesa molto dall'idea che avevo, a differenza di altri libri a cui ho dato 2 stelle che mi hanno davvero delusa. IEWU è un libro che tratta di una tematica estremamente importante e difficile con disarmare e secondo me inappropriata leggerezza. È bello leggere libri che trattano della tematica della violenza, ma secondo me, questo tema non è compatibile con questa tipologia di genere letterario. Questo libro romanticizza troppo l'argomento, inserendolo nel contesto della tipica commedia romantica che mia mamma si vede mentre sta seduta sul divano e dorme, con una protagonista che sembra uscita da wattpad piena di problemi che porca miseria tutta la iella del mondo ce l'ha lei, incoerente in molti punti e, com'è tipico dei romance, avventata e ingenua (quando le fa comodo), per non parliamo dell'inserimento di un triangolo amoroso che è ciò che più odio in un libro, figuriamoci se tratta di un argomento tanto importante. Secondo me, dà un cattivo esempio dell'amore in generale per alcune scelte di Lily, sconsigliato ai più piccoli che crescono con un'idea sbagliata. Mi sono sentita come una madre che corregge il testo della bambina ed è bruttissimo da dire perchè io sí sono una scrittrice ma non sono nessuno in confronto a Colleen e anche molto più piccola. Per questo dico non ancora, secondo me l'idea si base cè, ma bisogna riscriverlo. Non buona l' idea di unire romance e questa tematica, in più una cosa che stona molto è l'utilizzo della prima persona narrante. Il tutto, inoltre, sembra svolgersi troppo velocemente.

📍 Ovaj post danas je inspirisala drugarica koja nije znala moje mišljenje na ovu knjigu pre današnjeg dana  i rekla je da je možda ne bi uzela da je znala, nego bi je čitala na drugačiji način

Pomislila sam tad da će možda još nekoj duši biti korisno da ostavim svoje (nepopularno) mišljenje! 
⭐️⭐️⭐️/5 

📖 Sigurna sam da svi već znate sinopsis ali ukratko, spisateljica Louen je izabranica da nastavi  poznati serijal Veriti Kroford nakon što je Veriti onesposobljena da ga završi posle jako teške povrede, nakon koje je pod stalnim nadozorom i brigom muža Dzeremija, sa njihovim sinom. Louen, kako bi prikupila sve potrebne beleške odlazi do Veritine kuće i pronalazi sakrivene autobiografske rukopise u kojima se kriju ispovesti koji će zaprepastiti i nju i vas. 

Smatram da nisam pravedna u ovoj situaciji jer mnogo knjiga imaju slične nelogičnosti koje ja smatram da Veriti ima. 

❗️ Triler je koji je jako jeziv, na momente bolestan i koji sadrži scene od kojih će žmarci da vam prođu kroz kičmu. Priča kojoj ćete se gaditi i koje će te se bojati istovremeno. 
(Scena kada Louen gleda snimak kamere?!?)
Ali nije bilo dovoljno. 

❌️ MINOR SPOILERS ❌️

Atrakcija koja je nastupila izmedju Dzeremija i Louen je nelogičnost koju ne mogu da prihvatim. 
Naći se u situaciji u kojoj je Louen bila, normalna osoba nije videla kao priliku da razvije maštu u tom pravcu, niti situacije kroz koje se to ispoljavalo nisu bile nimalo primamljive da se mašti da na slobodu. 
Pritom, mogućnost da imaš poverenja u bilo koga u takvoj situaciji je tanka.

Razmisljanje i logika Louen da treba da zaštiti, esencijalno stranca kog je upoznala nekoliko dana pre je...🧐

Smatram da je ceo taj ark bio bespotreban i čak bi učinio priču jos jezivijom da je izostavljen. 

Lično, pobegla bih od svo troje glavom bez obzira. 

Nisam čitala bonus chapter koji je izaśao i ne verujem da ću jer nisam znatiželjna.

18266886454106852;"👑LA PRISIONERA DE ORO👑

BUENO, hoy os traigo la reseña de un libro muy controvertido por bookstagram y que ha sido una de mis mayores decepciones del año. Antes de adentrarte en este libro, si te llama la atención, te recomiendo que busques los TW.

No voy a decir de qué va, porque en la segunda foto tienes la sinopsis, así que me meto en el meollo directamente.

A favor de este libro diré que se lee muy fácil. La pluma es ágil y la forma de escribir de la autora hace que no te pierdas en ningún momento.

No obstante, creo que eso es casi lo único bueno que puedo decir de este libro. Y no porque quiera destriparlo o porque me haya horrorizado, para nada, sino porque he acabado con la sensación de que no ha pasado nada. No hay trama (de verdad, prácticamente no hay nada de lo que tirar) y el desarrollo de los personajes es prácticamente inexistente.

Comprendo que es un inicio de saga y que tiene que sentar muchas bases, así como presentar el worldbuilding, pero creo que se pasa un poco de planteamiento. Hasta las últimas 80 páginas no empiezan a suceder cosas realmente, y tampoco son de las que te vuelan la cabeza.

Y también me he llevado un chasco con la parte ""dark"". Sí es cierto que se plantea un universo desagradable, pero lo pintaron tan grotesco en redes que me he encontrado con algo (para mi gusto) descafeinado. Aunque entiendo que haya gente a la que le desagrade, yo tengo mucho estómago y he leído cosas más turbias y duras que no se han categorizado de este modo. 

Así que no he tenido ni una trama que me picara la curiosidad y me enganchara para los siguientes ni unos personajes que me hayan cautivado. Ni tampoco +18 del bueno, las cosas como son. Porque si una elige este libro es por lo que es.

En resumen, a mi gusto ha sido un quiero y no puedo. Eso sí, leeré el segundo porque todo el mundo dice que el primero es el peor. Así que, siendo una saga larga, le daré otra oportunidad.

⭐2/5⭐

17991338083622228;"🎁 Should we incentivize training and/or good habits?

I often get clients asking me to set a scale number or something similar as a short-term goal that they can incentivize to stay motivated. I also see a lot of posts from high atop soap boxes saying that this is a bad thing. 

Listen, in a perfect world, everyone would enjoy training, feel motivated all the time, and enjoy eating lean protein and veggies every meal. But that’s not reality, no matter how hard certain fit-fluencers want to make you believe it.

I am totally OK with a client using a new gym outfit or a pair of earrings or a new golf club as an incentive to build good habits. I don’t like to use the scale or bodyfat % for this as I believe it can create an unhealthy mental link between a number and internal feelings of success, but something like successfully completing all of one’s scheduled training sessions, or getting enough protein in, or daily walks etc is ok in my book. Motivation often follows action. Let these wins stack up. 

For example: if a person completes their first two weeks of a program successfully, they get to buy a new gym outfit. They get the new outfit, then the motivation is there to wear it to go train. They continue training and there’s a positive mental correlation there.

This probably can’t and shouldn’t be repeated in perpetuity (unless you’ve got a big stack of money burning a hole in your pocket I suppose), but it CAN be a good first step toward positive action. Just use sparingly.

Just my 2 cents…

🏘The Last House Guest🏘- I enjoyed All the Missing Girls so much, I bought this and read it totally blind 

2.5/5

WHICH WAS A TOTAL MISTAKE. idk if this is a hot take, but I couldn’t wait for this book to be over! I know, life is short and I can always DNF, but I kept hoping things would turn around. They didn’t. This story takes place a year after a girl dies. I’m sorry, but ya girl is way too big into crime to believe Avery, the main character with absolutely no brains or remarkable characteristics, is gonna find some new evidence a whole year later- about what may or may not have been a crime??🤨 This book also only talks about the past- it’s just her describing past events and people. Very detailed, but omg I just didn’t care about any of it- the place, the people, the party- nothing. nada. zilch. And the big reveal just wasn’t that big to me.. I’m so disappointed, and I know she’s well loved by booksta, but this entirely missed the mark for me 😩

Two VERY different books but with the exact same meh rating from me. 

A Flicker in the Dark 
♥ ♥ ♥
This book starts out really well. It’s a common plot for those that read thrillers: self-medicating main character with a parent that went to prison when they were a child. I guessed one of the “twists” before 100 pages and the others just weren’t *great*. The ending left me with more questions than answers and feeling so frustrated with every character and the author. 😖 If you’re a thriller newbie, snag this one! 

While We Were Dating 
♥ ♥ ♥
I think y’all know by now I’m not a fan of JG books. This type of cozy, mediocre romances just aren’t my thing. That being said.. this is my favorite Guillory that I’ve read but I refuse to read another. These mediocre romances that don’t have feelings, too many annoying sex scenes and an ending that’s just unrealistic really just annoy the hell out of me. The storyline was different so I’ll give it an extra ♥ for that. Not much else to say but I don’t recommend these types of romances ever sooo take that how you want 😆

♥️ On a positive note: we’re less than a week away from Valentine’s Day. I LOVE Valentine’s Day, all the hearts and that extra lovin’ feeling is my favorite. I buy my boys and husband a book for v-day every year and obviously allll the chocolate 😋

#QOTD What were your worst/most disappointing/not hype worthy reads this year?

Caution: Unpopular opinions ahead 😘

Most Disappointing:

— The Girl the Sea Gave Back • After Sky in the Deep, I was really looking forward to this sequel. The story ended up feeling flat and I was not as invested in the plot.

— The Jasmine Throne • Too many POV’s of insignificant characters that could have been used for our MC’s. There wasn’t much to excite me and keep me coming back.

— Down Comes The Night • Buddy read with nerdyfoxreads and we both came to the conclusion that the MC has no critical thinking skills.

— Girl, Serpent, Thorn • It was a beautiful setting but I was bored. 

Not Hype Worthy:

— Gideon the Ninth • Gideon’s character was so chaotic and I loved it. However, I just wasn’t invested in the plot and once I finished forgot half of what happened.

— Neon Gods (not pictured, unhauled) • Another let down for me in the trend that is Hades and Persephone. Boring and not as steamy as everyone is claiming it to be compared to Roberts other works.

The Worst:

— The Invisible Life of Addie Larue • Addie, I wanted to get lost in your story, but I forgot about you just like everyone else did. While the concept of this was intriguing enough, it fell flat and felt like we never got past the surface. Addie is just boring and bland. She literally wallowed for 300 years. 

— Kingdom of the Wicked (not pictured, unhauled) • Emilia is one of the most aggravating MCs I have ever encountered, and not in a “you’re supposed to dislike the character” way. Wrath was a copy/paste of every other broody/smoldery love interest and I didn’t care about him at all. The story was predictable and the only thing that kept me going was the food.

— The Crown of Gilded Bones • I can probably say I am done with this series. The repetition makes me want to scream. This book didn’t need to be as long as it was for absolutely NOTHING to happen until the end like every book before it. Kieran deserves better.

18000220792478522;"What is your embarrassing bookish confession?

I've talked so much on Bookstagram about how much I love fantasy books and particularly Sarah J Maas books. So I am super embarrassed to admit that I haven't actually finished the Throne of Glass series 🙊 I read the first 2 books a couple of years ago but I never continued. I wasn't the biggest fan and I struggled to believe that the main character was actually an assassin. 

However after joining Bookstagram, I've seen so many people talking about this series and sharing beautiful fanart. It seems like the series really picks up from book 3, as well as I would like to understand all the references I see over Bookstagram. So I would really like to give this series another chance at some point!

17928536498496417;"Katherine May. Überwintern - Wenn das Leben innehält. Aus dem Englischen von Marieke Heimburger 

Nach langer Zeit mal wieder ein Buch, das ich nicht zu Ende gelesen habe. 

Katherine May schreibt über ihre persönlichen Winter. Damit ist nicht die Jahreszeit gemeint, sondern dunkle, schwierige Lebensphasen, in denen sich die Autorin/Ich-Erzählerin zurückziehen möchte. 

Ich kann schon nachvollziehen, dass das Buch viele Lesende abholt. Der Essay ist in einer klaren Sprache geschrieben und Katherine May hat sicher Recht damit, dass mensch die stillen und düsteren Phasen braucht und dass zuviel Positivismus ungesund ist. Mich hat ""Überwintern"" leider nicht angesprochen. 

Mir blieben die geschilderten Einsichten zu belanglos. Es hat mich nicht besonders interessiert, mit welchen Buntstiften die Autorin malt, wie sie Gemüse einlegt und welchen Eintopf sie sich kocht. Und auch die zugrundeliegenden Themen, mit denen sie sich beschäftigt, wie Spiritualität, Krankheit oder der Schulangst ihres Sohnes konnten mich leider nicht erreichen. 

Ich habe ""Überwintern"" nach der Hälfte abgebrochen. Mittlerweile bin ich wahrscheinlich auch einfach gesättigt von Essays und Autofiktion. Für 2023 habe ich die Textform erst einmal von meiner Liste gestrichen.

Title: Icebreaker
Author: Hannah Grace
Rating: ⭐️⭐️ (2/5)

I’m only posting this review because I haven’t seen one negative review about it and I’m hoping I’m not the only one who didn’t get the hype.

This book was all over the place and there was no definitive story line. There were so many useless points and characters brought into the story that had no significance later on in the book.

Why continuously talk about the jump Stassie can’t land if she won’t even attempt it in the competition? Why make Nate learn her entire routine, be present during the competition, and then let her walk away when he could have skated with her in front of the judges? This book could have ended so much better than what it did. I guess the epilogue was a nice touch.

This book was poorly written and there were grammar mistakes. The book supposedly has an enemies to lovers trope, but Stassie was dramatic and “hated” Nate for no reason, there was no tension leading up to them getting together, and they got together really early on in the book. A little angst or pining would have made it better.

This book was boring, long, and the characters were awful. I just cannot be bothered. Don’t waste your time.";2023-02-17 15:09:31+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:35.188276+00:00;24;0;en

In Every Mirror She’s Black by Lolá Ákínmádé Åkerström
Rating: ⭐️⭐️
>>>swipe for synopsis>>>

Okay, so. I don’t normally like to review books this way, but I don’t feel like I can appropriately describe my issues with this book without talking about specific plot points. So if you want to read this without being spoiled, do not read my review below.

🚨Spoiler Alert🚨

I’ve had this book on my TBR forever and, while I kept putting it off for unknown reasons, I was genuinely excited to read it. I loved the themes it purported to address - racism, tokenism, sexism, and classicism - and the concept of viewing them through the lens of expats living in Swedish society specifically. And it does all that. I didn’t necessarily think the message was super strong given that it focused a lot more than needed on the three characters sexual relationships as opposed to their jobs and experiences abroad as I’d hoped, but nevertheless, it is an interesting book. 

However. One of the “love interests” depicted in this book is shown to be, well, a total sociopath. He’s narcissistic and destructive and downright dangerous. Which would be fine if his behavior is not then blamed on him being autistic. It’s a frankly hurtful and damaging portrayal that is completely unneeded in this book and ruined the entire thing for me. 

Even besides that insane choice, the stories of the three women never came together for me, and the ending is, IMO, written for shock value alone, so it was all going downhill after the “reveal.”

I give this 2 stars solely for some of the nuance in the first 75% of the book, but I do not, in anyway, recommend this novel to anyone 🤷🏼‍♀️

Uwaga kolejne pozytywne zaskoczenie ze strony Colleen Hoover!! Spodziewałam się przesłodzonej historii o niczym albo w kółko o tym samym, a otrzymałam ciekawą historię, przy której czytaniu czuć było, że autorka świetnie bawiła się przy jej pisaniu i ta radość wręcz emanuje ze stron podczas lektury.
„It ends with us” było dla mnie okropnym rozczarowaniem, książka się dłużyła, a kiedy doszło do punktu kulminacyjnego, jak dla mnie nie był on warty tych męczarni.
„It starts with us” natomiast przeczytałam na raz i uważam, że okazał się to jako ogromny plus dla mojej recenzji. Dalej nie jest to nic wybitnego (ani potrzebnego), ale mimo to bardzo przyjemnie się czytało o czyimś szczęściu 🥹

The battle is not a human one.

The fight to protect babies not yet born, to cherish them, to view life as sacred is a supernatural battle that will only be won individually with supernatural intervention in the human heart.

Sin is not eradicated with a piece of paper, it is eradicated with the outpouring of the blood of Christ, and the work of God.

⭐️⭐️ The Maid by Nita Prose

Molly is a maid at a fancy hotel. A customer ends up dead under suspicious circumstances, and Molly is accused of the murder.

•-•-•-•

I’ve seen so many glowing reviews of this book, but I was sadly not a fan. Molly is overly formal, has difficulty reading and responding to social cues, and is clearly supposed to be neurodivergent (no formal definition is ever given), but she comes off as more of a quirky, precious, dingbat (like a Zooey Deschanel character), and not as a fully-developed person with any real definition or depth. 

The inconsistency in her reactions really got to me — she was conveniently super confused or totally on the ball depending on what the situation called for to drag the plot out. And boy did it drag. 

Mr. Black’s death is explained in the epilogue and it was completely infuriating and made the preceding 275+ pages even more befuddling and irritating. 

I don’t know. I liked the idea of this book much more than I liked actually reading it.

17909479709364457;"♡ Mediocre Minis ♡ 

Back at it with the mini reviews because I’m behind and I don’t love putting negativity out there with a bunch of mediocre reviews sooo here are three mini mediocre reviews! 

♡ No Words ~ This is an enemies to lovers romance, my favorite trope! But the story was so awkward, the main character is super childish and everything just magically happens at the end of the book without any real resolution, etc. and it does. not. work. I would recommend this book for 12-14 year olds. 

♡ The Suite Spot ~ I loved Float Plan and was so excited for this sequel. However, it fell flat for me! It felt like the whole story was just skimming the top of everything, no character development, weird relationships, the conflict was horrendous, and gah! she drops her child off with strangers..? 🙅🏼‍♀️ A lot of things didn’t make sense and there didn’t feel to be connections and then suddenly they were in love? Didn’t work for me. 

♡ And They Lived Happily Ever After ~ This book is about an author that dreams what she writes. The writing was so confusing in this book, I was halfway through when *I think* I understood how her writing/dreams worked. The romance was okay, no smut aside from some steamy kisses. Would probably recommend the same as No Words. 🤷🏼‍♀️ 

All three of these are ♥ ♥ ♥ for me! There was no smut in any of these. Some steamy kisses and some hints at smut only!

Book Review 

The Silent Patient 
⭐️⭐️⭐️/5

I know thriller fans are big lovers of this one, but I’m sorry, it just didn’t really do much for me.

There were aspects I loved! Trying to figure out what happened to Alicia kept me turning the pages. The writing was great. The problem is that the twist was so hyped up and I just…wasn’t impressed. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

I feel a little burned by this author tbh. This and The Maidens were so hyped and just didn’t live up to it for me. 😬

I was kindly #gifted by librofm the audiobook version of Carrie Soto is Back by Taylor Jenkins Reid, I have only read Daisy Jones and I found this one to be very similar in the writing style. 

I unfortunately couldn’t get my head in it, totally my fault as I am just not a tennis fan.

I’ve been told by a very reliable source that Malibu Rising is a very good read so I’ll give that one a whirl and see how I go.

🥳 pub day: 9/14 
✍🏼 same author that wrote BIG LITTLE LIES, NINE PERFECT STRANGERS, WHAT ALICE FORGOT
read if you like: slow burns that never pay off🥲

it’s not often i say i hate a book because i don’t like going into books knowing people i trust disliked it, but you guys—i cannot think of one good thing about this book. the length, the characters, the ending, the insensitive jabs at mental illnesses and domestic violence, the infidelity… just was all a big fat nope for me. like NINE PERFECT STRANGERS, i kept waiting… and waiting… and 469 pages later i think i’m still waiting 😂 slow burns are fine if they pay off this just did not. i truly wish i DNF it. 

APPLES NEVER FALL had an intriguing plot. when Joy Delaney—mother of four, wife—uncharacteristically goes missing, her children begin to worry. with all them out of the house, who else could be involved in her disappearance but their father? was their marriage in worse shape than they realized? after all, i am always down for some family drama and mystery… 😩 

Liane is a fan fave and i heard mixed things going in which usually makes me want to check it out for myself and i encourage you to do whatcha gotta do bc hey, you might like it! there were parts that had me laughing and i enjoyed the banter but at some point it became too much… and the random COVID chapter??? FYI, red apples were never mentioned 🤦🏼‍♀️🤪

when comparing her least popular books, i found NINE PERFECT STRANGERS to be boring but it atleast that had a plot twist and an interesting ending 🥴 all that said… based on her more recent work, i’m beginning to think Liane Moriarty is no longer for me 🤷🏼‍♀️

#feelfreetodisagree 

I'm late to the party with this one which has sat on my shelf for a while. I've read great reviews on here for it so was an anticipated 4.5 or 5 star. 

However, firstly it's just too long. I don't mind a big read but this felt like a drag at some points.  It starts slow,  it has too many unnecessary side stories, the time lines jump about all over the place and the current day story is so minimal that I wonder if it was needed at all? 

I did enjoy the historical part of the story, the flying during the war,  the prohibition years,  then the attempt at circumnavigation and the author has done her research well to fit in so much. 

I realise this is probably an #unpopularopinion but I stick by my 3.5 for the above reasons (but I don't think I'll forget it either. ) 

Have you read this? What did you think?

When you have a good day, ride that wave.

This is going to feel very ""unpopular opinion""-ish. I will start by explaining that a 3-Star book is one I LIKED and recommend. Keep this in mind....because 🥁 ....

3.75/5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️💫

...it's almost a 4 but it lacked capturing my attention for most of the book and I still don't love Feyre (I'm kind of neutral).

I loved....

❤ Rhys....everything about him!! He's flirty, protective, and supportive. Secretly, he had my attention in ACOTAR, it wasn't hard to get here. 

❤ Banter!!!! I loved Rhys and Feyre’s banter and their note writing.

❤ Supporting Characters.  This book has some of the best!  Give me more!!

❤ Feyre’s character development (she got on my nerves in ACOTAR). I'm seeing her bada*s side come out.  The difference between ACOTAR Feyre and ACOMAF Feyre may prove SJM's talent for writing.  Maybe this should earn a higher rating 🤷‍♀️ but...

For someone who binges on books, this took me over a month to finish. Even though the pacing was much better than ACOTAR I still found it sluggish for the first half.  With the length of the book, it felt daunting to get to the ""good stuff"". (No, not the steam)

Dare I say it, there were no big surprises and it gave me Twilight vibes (no...not vampires) and I'm not sure my feelings on this (not the lack of vampires...the vibe).

SJM has created a beautiful world but I felt the need to take notes so I could remember. Maybe this is because it took me so long to read it that I lost details in between. 🤷‍♀️

QOTD: 𝙒𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙙𝙤 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙬𝙖𝙣𝙩 𝙞𝙣𝙘𝙡𝙪𝙙𝙚𝙙 𝙞𝙣 𝙖 𝙧𝙚𝙫𝙞𝙚𝙬?

AOTD:  I want a brief spoiler-free summary, what the reader liked, and even what they didn't like.  I can then judge for myself if it's a book for me.

I've come to realize that a summary is helpful on IG.  Not everyone knows what a book is about...I realize I left out a summary. Swipe ➡️ for the blurb.

17912339606230221;"The dance industry has become a place for social justice warriors to cry victim to remain relevant, instead of humbly work to hone a craft, profession and art form. 

I have watched the left’s ideas become implemented in the studio, bringing politics into the art form and turning it to trash. What used to be a world of sacrifice, integrity, and passion has turned to ignorance, entitlement and narcissism. The dancers who are unable to face their own flaws, accept and work daily to improve and change... have instead made a career of professional complaints...whether it’s about equality, racism, climate change, pandemic protocols, trans rights...you name it...there will always be a larger liberal issue at hand that “we” must solve...a constant internalized oppression for an invisible minority group of the month...but like the recent drama of the prestigious ballet competition prixdelausanne , after seeing the board of all white judges, the Instagram comments went wild, demanding representation of diversity.  In a ballet competition, i must ask, is it truly important that every race is represented? Doesn’t that cause us to hyper focus on race alone, by the awareness that we must find a top ballet dancer in each race to come judge a competition so that the dancers can be judged “fairly”. 

Looking at the demographics of ballet alone being predominantly a European art form, where most of the future company positions that the dancers at the Prix de Lausanne are competing for being in Germany, France and England...It is safe to say that dancers from other countries would be outnumbered by the European dancers. Most European dancers happen to have white skin. When I see a panel of white judges I do not automatically think, “Where is the black judge!?” because I am not looking for skin color to fill a quota. It’s one thing to prioritize diversity, but we must also recognize the field we are in and the variables at hand. What happened to prioritizing the ability of the dancer over the color of their skin? 

 It’s racist to see skin color and obsess over it when human beings have so much more to offer than the color of our skin. #unpopularopinion

I am ppstarting off this Monday morning with an unpopular opinion. But if you have read this book I would love to see your thoughts❗️

Kate and Bella. Bella and Kate.  A friendship that was off and on since they were six years old.  Kate the beautiful, confident, actress and Bella the one who always seems to be left behind. Bella does develop into a confident painter as the years progress. They find themselves together and as friends sporadically throughout their lives.  Always ending with a harsh falling out.  I had a tough time with this book.  I did not connect with any of the characters.  The dialogue was choppy and hard to follow at times.  It is an extremely quick read.  Thank you to Jessica Fellowes, St. Martin’s Press, and Minotaur Books for gifting me this book.

What book are you starting this week off with❓

17954127106607850;"Placing this here because it is a conversation I often have with folks in private when tragedies happens in our community and are referred to as a ""BIPoC"" issue.

I strongly suggest that unless you are referring to a topic or issue that affects the globally diverse group of individuals placed under this acronym, as a collective, BE SPECIFIC. 

While tragedies, when they happen, tend to highlight inequities in faced by people who have a non-white identity, not every thing directly affects every group under that lumped identity.

Peter Spencer was not BIPOC - he was a Black Man.

Breonna Taylor was not BIPoC - she was a Black woman.

Ahmaud Arbery was not BIPoC - he was Black a man.

Sandra Bland was not BIPoC - she was Black woman.

George Floyd was not BIPoC - he was a Black Man.

I think you get the picture.

What we can do is, as a collective, stand up against injustices driven by racism that happens in the individual communities that society lumps under a single descriptor. Call out the anti-Blackness that exists in many of these same BIPoC communities. 

Saying BIPoC just makes it easier to digest. It doesn't make it easier to eradicate.

Patched Up
Author: Jessica Erin

Rating:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Notes: I received a copy of this book as an advanced reader, but all thoughts and opinions are my own.

What I Liked:
🎃I do not live on a farm or in a small town so I think I naturally gravitate towards books about them. There is always something so charming and warm about books that take place in those settings. The real bonus is that there are a number of festivals and holidays that also happen over the course of the book. Basically, all of my favorite things!

🎃Hudson was a very sweet and charming MMC while also having a little bit of a dirtier side. He also shines when he communicates openly with Emery. Who knew communication could be such a turn on???

🎃Emery and Grace are so supportive of each other. I’m *hoping* we’ll get more of their friendship in book 2 of this series. I love reading about women who support other women! 

🎃Every time Gracie was on the page it made smile and want to cuddle with my dog! 🐶 

What I Didn’t Like:
🎃My only complaint was that I picked this book after Thanksgiving and not in the beginning of November. However it really spans the entire season from October through Christmas so any lover of the holidays would enjoy this! 

Final Thoughts: 
🎃 Jessica Erin’s writing style is a perfect match for anyone who loves Hallmark movies, but might also want a little bit of spice. It’s the perfect balance without going too overboard. A wonderful addition to my favorite authors list!

I can’t eat chocolate, I don’t wear jewelry and flowers are dead within a week 😂

But for real- I stopped at the local grocery store around dinner time and saw all these guys walking out with all the leftover flowers from the day. The thought is always nice BUT what if you spent everyday loving, supporting and caring those you love about?  And not just because the calendar says February 14th 🙃

_

Ho letto Jonathan Strange e Il Signor Norrell insieme al #mattonazzigdl mio e di giadadomani, anche se letto non è esattamente la parola giusta visto che l’ho interrotto a metà. 

Avevo altissime aspettative su questo libro e speravo davvero potesse piacermi, ma purtroppo non è andata come speravo.

Non è una novità, perché di solito odio i libri super acclamati, ma in questo caso speravo davvero che valesse l’hype, visto che molte persone di cui mi fido qui sui social lo avevano amato. 

Non fraintendetemi, capisco perché il libro piaccia, ma purtroppo io al di là della bellissima scrittura, delle ambientazioni e di alcune premesse interessanti, non ho trovato quello che cercavo o speravo.

Ho trovato la narrazione estremamente lenta, frammentaria, a tratti sconclusionata e, per gran parte della lettura, ho avuto come l’impressione che, nonostante le tantissime pagine macinate, non si arrivasse mai ad un punto e che la storia “vera” facesse fatica ad ingranare.

Mi sembrava di leggere tanti piccoli racconti uniti da unico filo conduttore ma comunque sempre distaccati dalla trama principale, e questa cosa è stata fastidiosa. 

Inoltre, anche i personaggi, per quanto magistralmente scritti, non hanno suscitato in me un minimo di interesse e, ad essere sincera, non ero nemmeno curiosa di conoscere le loro sorti.

Ho provato ad andare avanti sperando migliorasse ma, quando ho capito che nulla sarebbe cambiato e che nemmeno l’audiolibro mi stava aiutando, ho deciso a malincuore di abbandonarlo.

La vita è troppo breve e i libri da leggere sono tanti, perciò mi sono detta che non aveva senso continuare a torturarmi così. 

Credo sia stata la scelta più giusta in questo caso, ma vorrei comunque provare a dare una seconda possibilità alla Clarke perché la sua scrittura mi è piaciuta molto. Proverò magari a recuperare qualcosa di più breve.

18009953302556349;"Intentar reseñar este libro creo que será bastante complicado, #unpopularopinion tal vez, pero aqui voy.

 
Los 7 maridos de Evelyn Hugo de Taylor Jenkins Reid, la autora de Todos quiere a Daisy Jones y de la cual pronto habrá una serie creo que en Amazon Prime, bueno tambien se espera que Evelyn Hugo tenga su propia película en Netflix.

 Un libro que te atrapa fácilmente, con mucho drama, plot twists, mucho amor, desamor, traiciones, fama, machismo y homofobia, cosa muy interesante de leer...

La historia sigue a Monique Grant, quien ha sido elegida por Evelyn Hugo -una actriz icónica de Hollywood- para contar su historia y escribir su biografía, su trayecto a la fama y todo lo que hay detrás del mundo del cine de los años 50.

Como ya saben que soy una junkie 🤓 de los libros investigue más de la autora y del propio libro cuando termine de leer, y  Taylor Jenkins Reid ha dicho que la heroína de este bestseller está basado -ligeramente- en Elizabeth Taylor, quién es bien sabido que se casó ocho veces y con siete hombres diferentes, otro tanto en Ava Gardner, quién se atrevió a relevar los secretos de su vida a una periodista y fueron publicados en su libro de memorias y en Rita Hayworth. Incluso, hay quienes le encuentran un parecido a Marilyn Monroe, así que Imagínense el dramon.💃

Lo recomiendo... SI, la verdad es que disfrute mucho la lectura, pensaba que seria diferente, la verdad es que si, pense que seria mas profundo, no creo que sea la obra maestra que todo mundo contaba en, tiktok, booktube o cualquier red social que hable de libros, pero vale la pena leerlo.

 Mis frases favoritas:

🌹El carisma es ""el encanto que inspira devoción"".

🌹Cuando te dan la oportunidad de cambiar tu vida, debes estar dispuesta para hacer lo que sea con tal de lograrlo. El mundo no te da cosas: TU DEBES TOMARLAS.

🌹Ser una misma, sin esconder nada, siempre será como nadar contra la corriente.

🌹Nadie es completamente bueno o malo. Lo sé, por supuesto, tuve que aprenderlo a una edad temprana. Pero a veces es fácil olvidar lo cierto que es.

17877650039698741;"Today I was asked what motivates me to do what I do…

At first, being the silly awkward twit that I am, I wanted to reply ‘new boots’ simply because this weekend I purchased a pair of beautiful new boots that I couldn’t afford (and also can’t wear for more than a few hours- these boots are a treat for the eye…punishment for my feet!) however obviously this is not my real motivation , more a quick witty reply to buy me some time to actually think about it… because actually I’ve never been asked this before, or maybe I’ve never truly thought about it… 🤔

There is the obvious:
money - I’ve got bills to pay and we all know these are not getting smaller, I live a fairly average life, We’ve got food on the table but it’s not fine dining, we’ve got a roof over our heads but it’s falling apart 😬 we go on holiday but rarely on a plane…. I’d be lying if I said finances didn’t motivate me on a day to day basis. A few extra quid would go a long way to renovating our house and getting us to Disneyland!

But if I really dig deep, and I mean REALLY dig deep and ask myself ‘what motivates the desire to make more money?’… it’s my kids and my relentless mum guilt. 
Not because I want to dress them head to toe in Gucci or drive them around in 4x4 Lamborghini … it’s not even because I want to take them on fancy holidays and buy them the latest toys. But I do want them to see the benefits of hard working parents:
sadly I have missed sports days because I’m preparing a funeral piece, I miss most of the summer holidays because it falls smack bang in the middle of wedding season, I’ve had to reschedule endless parents evenings and arrange lift shares for the school discos because I’ve had to work late… I don’t want that to be for nothing, I want the children to see I’ve done it for a reason, I want them to one day reap the seeds I’ve sown and have a strong work ethic too. 
I want to not worry about how we will afford the next school trip or to choose between that school trip and a family trip!

Maybe this is an unpopular opinion, maybe I’ve just lost brownie points on the mums of Instagram score chart…  or maybe you have similar motivations? 

I’m interested now… what motivates YOU?";2022-09-26 08:48:45+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:39.404629+00:00;5;37;en

Comin atcha with another unpopular opinion as this has a 4.02 Goodreads rating. I’m not having the best luck with books lately 😔 

I do think some people will find this one very entertaining, but it just didn’t sit right with me. If you’re wanting to read this one, then stop here because I’m not very nice below…

Did I like this one? I thought I was liking it enough until the ending. It was so far fetched, ridiculously overdone, and quite frankly, made me hate the characters even more 😬

The pace was slow as you spend most of the time in the MC’s repetitive, inner thoughts, but it has short chapters, so that’s a plus!

The family…wealthy and TWISTED. Their family “games” made me sick, and I was disgusted that they would put their own family members through them because it “builds character.” I just couldn’t get behind any of it. 

I would have been running for the hills after meeting that family 😂 

I probably won’t be recommending this one, but if you’ve read it, I’d love to know your thoughts! Maybe those of you that loved it can help me see the good in it 🤷🏻‍♀️

⭐️⭐️💫 (2.5/5)

Okay I know a lot of people like this one, but it really just didn’t do it for me. I actually don’t know why but I feel like I never got into the story and never really felt like I understood what was going on. I felt like I read an entire book but retained nothing from it. So here’s a super honest, unpopular opinion coming your way. 

Swipe for synopsis!

Okay let’s get into this, so originally I rated this one three stars, but as I came to write this review I realized I had no idea what actually happened in this book. I know the general premise because of the synopsis and a bit from what I read, but I retained like nothing from this book. A big reason was that the writing style didn’t work for me. I never fully understood who was speaking at any given moment which was not helpful to me by any means. I would have liked to see a bit more emphasis on who was speaking during each chapter. 

The other reason I struggled with this book was that it was extremely character driven, and I tend to lean more towards plot driven books. I can get behind character driven books when I understand who the characters are, but these characters felt very sporadic throughout the book. 

I definitely think I need to give this one another read in the future so I can better appreciate it. I buddy read this one with sidekicksam and she loved it so I’ll definitely give it a reread and reevaluate my thoughts (especially since it’s such a quick little book to read in the first place). I also agree with Sam that I wish this was a little longer because I think I would have been able to better situate who everyone was and what was happening in the story. 

❓What are your thoughts on this book if you read it❓";2022-01-06 19:20:48+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:39.420251+00:00;6;321;en
17947516216968484;"Riley Sager sure writes some twisty books, doesn’t he? His newest novel, The House Across the Lake, will be available on June 28 - thank you duttonbooks and netgalley for the free #giftedbook.

I’ve seen some pretty mixed reviews for this one, and to be very honest, this is probably my least favorite out of all his books so far. It does have some big twists towards the end, but I found the first half of the book pretty slow. I did like the suspense built by the alternating ‘Before’ and ‘Now’ chapters, because they kept me guessing. I will admit I thought I knew what was going to happen and I was very wrong, but that’s both a good and bad thing once I realized what was happening.

If you are a Sager fan, still read this - there are several 4 and 5 star reviews on Goodreads!

Synopsis via GR:
Casey Fletcher, a recently widowed actress trying to escape a streak of bad press, has retreated to the peace and quiet of her family’s lake house in Vermont. Armed with a pair of binoculars and several bottles of liquor, she passes the time watching Tom and Katherine Royce, the glamorous couple who live in the house across the lake. They make for good viewing—a tech innovator, Tom is rich; and a former model, Katherine is gorgeous.

One day on the lake, Casey saves Katherine from drowning, and the two strike up a budding friendship. But the more they get to know each other—and the longer Casey watches—it becomes clear that Katherine and Tom’s marriage is not as perfect and placid as it appears. When Katherine suddenly vanishes, Casey becomes consumed with finding out what happened to her. In the process, she uncovers eerie, darker truths that turn a tale of voyeurism and suspicion into a story of guilt, obsession and how looks can be very deceiving.

18218556952196131;"The People You Meet on Vacation
By Emily Henry

⭐️⭐️⭐️

QOTD: Have you ever gone from friends to lovers?

In high school I was really good friends with a guy and we ended up becoming boyfiend/girlfriend for our senior year. But this has not happened as an adult. 

Before diving into Emily Henry’s books for the first time this summer, I read that here are typically two groups of people. Those who love Beach Read and her newest book and those who love People You Meet on Vacation. I didn’t think it was possible. I didn’t think the books could be that different since they’re written by the same author. But I am a believe now. I struggled with parts of this book. I definitely loved Beach Read. I liked the premise and liked that we got to see the relationship between friends to lovers evolve throughout time as it goes back and forth between the present and the past. But parts of the book dragged for me. It was a cute read, but not great, at least for me. I am hoping I will be satisfied more by Book Lovers.

If u'r allergic to unpopular opinions, don't read this ""review""!
I skipped 172 pages and got straight to the last chapter to get over with this. I heard and read a lot about Pride & Prejudice, I was HYPED to read it, but I just didn't have it in me to keep wasting time reading about a bunch of families, whose names I don't even remember, going to visit each other and have dinner and have tea and attend parties, while there are far more interesting books on my TBR, waiting to jump into my arms 🥺
I wanted to read about Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, but unfortunately the story was STUFFED with tons of side characters about whom I couldn't care less, and as a result, the two main characters barely had any presence in the book, especially Mr. Darcy, I get that the character of Elizabeth Bennett was probably ""revolutionary"" in the time the story was first published, but come on, Mr. Darcy deserved some spotlight, too, instead of being insulted and criticised by everyone all the time.
I love classics, but not all classics are for me, and not all classics are worth the hype 🤷🏻‍♀

I don’t use or own a microwave! I can’t remember how long it’s been since we got rid of it but back then the biggest argument was that it’s so convenient to reheat your coffee! I was like... get out a pan and warm it up lol! Yes... I would rather dirty a small pan if I need to reheat something than use a microwave. 
Why?
~I’m just not into “nuking” my food
~ kids need to learn how to really cook on the stove. Microwaving isn’t cooking. 
~ modern conveniences aren’t always better for you 
~ we can go back and forth about if there are health impacts or not of microwaving your food and the EMF it gives off but I don’t care. I feel in my gut it isn’t healthy so I follow that inner guidance. 
.
PS.... I’m honestly starting to feel the same way about my Air fryer and my Instant Pot .... I know I probably made you gasp! (I use it more like a slow cooker anyway so it stays for now haha)
.
What do you think?
Do you own a microwave?
How do you feel about conveniences that supposedly make our lives better? Do they really??

Curious what you think??

Auf dem Buchdeckel heißt es ""If Bridgerton and Fleabag had a book baby, it would be Reputation."" 
Damit hat man mich natürlich! Ich schätze 'Bridgerton' sehr und halte 'Fleabag' für wahrscheinlich das Beste, was jemals im Serienformat produziert wurde. 

Dass 'Reputation' diese Erwartungen nicht erfüllen kann, ist eigentlich schon klar! Trotzdem fand ich's über Strecken sehr unterhaltsam und auch witzig. Das größte Manko war für mich tatsächlich, dass es stellenweise wirklich dark wurde und das hat mich irgendwie unvorbereitet getroffen. Ich finde schon, dass es einen Unterschied macht, ob es um Ausschweifungen und regency-untypische Partys geht oder ob man plötzlich mit der harten Realität von sexueller Nötigung konfrontiert ist.
Dieser eine Erzählstrang, der zum Ende her hin immer präsenter wird, hat mich völlig rausgebracht und ehrlich gesagt mir einiges an Lesefreude geraubt. 

Jetzt gibt es ja ein neues Lex Croucher Buch und ich bin innerlich immer noch am debattieren, ob ich es wohl lesen soll. Habt ihr eine Empfehlung?

Adoré a Jay Kristoff en Nuncanoche y no sabéis el hype que tenía con este libro. Pensaba que sería el libro del año y que superaría sus anteriores historias. Pero no ha sido así. ¿El problema? Que son 930págs para que no pase nada en todo el libro, se puede resumir todo en una página y el resto le sobra.

➕Puntos positivos: 
-Me encanta la manera de narrar del autor.
-La trama de vampiros y religión me pareció acertada e increíble, al igual que los personajes principales. 

✖Puntos negativos:
-Trama que promete y termina siendo repetitiva y tediosa.
-Incógnitas que se plantean desde el inicio y tal cual se quedan.
-Personajes secundarios que me parecieron de relleno e innecesarios

17930307740433735;"Warning: Longest review I’ve ever written. I don’t want to yuck anyone’s yum, so please feel free to skip this. But I am trying to tease out something important here, so read on if you’re interested. Despite my eager anticipation, I have concerns about this book.

Celeste Ng’s latest novel, OUR MISSING HEARTS, is a mildly dystopian novel set in Massachusetts and New York in which a law entitled PACT enforces “patriotic behavior” and removes children from parents who are deemed unpatriotic (particularly children of Chinese ancestry, since China is blamed for America’s economic malaise). Bird Gardner, age 12, lives with his father in Cambridge, MA, after his mother Margaret, a Chinese American poet, vanished three years ago under mysterious circumstances. The book opens as he receives a cryptic message from her and follows his quest to find out more.

First, much of the novel was boring. Not much happens. The climax of the plot is predictable. The writing is fine, but nothing that I wanted to linger in for its own sake. Second, the character development was lackluster. None of the characters felt very real to me, nor did I grow attached to them or invested in their plights.

Third, I found the premise to be unbelievable. I live in Cambridge, where a large portion of the book takes place, and trust me, people are trying to out-woke each other here (I say that affectionately). I just don’t find a complete about-face due to an economic downturn that’s blamed on China plausible. The way things are going in the U.S., red states and blue states are polarizing further and getting more entrenched in their ideologies, so it’s hard to believe the denizens of Cambridge and NYC would just go along with some conservative senator’s fearmongering. Maybe I’m too optimistic, but Ng’s worldbuilding and explanatory model for the extreme racial animus towards Asians felt lacking.

(Off the top of my head, I can think of several things that would have made pervasive animosity towards Chinese Americans somewhat more believable: a terror or bioterrorism attack, a massive cyberattack or coordinated hacking, a declaration of war, etc.)

I really disliked this book! 

It reads like a bad Hallmark film with cringeworthy characters, cringeworthy sex and a cringeworthy plot line. 

The sex scenes were vomit inducing and, alongside the sickly sweet setting descriptions, it came across like an X-rated Disney film which, to be honest, crept me the fuck out. 

This is Hocus Pocus gone wrong. There’s something about a candle in here, a ghost set loose, a shit romance story. You get the gist! 

For me the pacing was way off, with everything crammed into the last 60 pages or so. 

The one thing I did like was the Halloween/ Autumnal setting. It was very Halloweentown and makes for a cosy read if you like that kind of thing. 

This is going on the “get rid” pile asap. I know lots of people love it, but cutesy romance is really not my thing. Now, someone pass me the sick bucket.

As a stay-at-home mom, it's easy to assume we know best. Society heavily pushes the ""women are always right"" mentality onto us. Sure, we make magic happen. Goddesses here on earth. But certainly not exempt from being mistaken. 

This year I learned the value of being a teachable woman. Understanding the importance of unlearning the ugly in oneself. And accepting accountability as an adult for why I allowed those ugly parts of me to still exist.

Identical twins Elli and Sam used to switch places growing up. They were child actors and when Elli didn’t want to do her part, Sam took over. Now they are grown up, leading very different lives, and are no longer speaking. Their parents contact Sam because Elli is missing and they need her to come help with a niece Sam didn’t even know she had.

Sam finds it odd of Elli to disappear and starts piecing together clues as to find her. Can Sam save Elli from the mess she’s gotten herself into?

So…I both liked and didn’t like this book. I was intrigued at first - twins switching places, one twin missing, weird crap going on…but I felt like I was waiting for a huge twist that didn’t happen for me. I also think this is more family drama than thriller. It has gotten several really good reviews, so maybe it’s just me - definitely check it out if the synopsis appeals to you!

I read 𝘋𝘢𝘪𝘴𝘺 𝘑𝘰𝘯𝘦𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘚𝘪𝘹 a few years ago and gave it a high rating, and I was hoping that this one would end in a way similar to 𝘋𝘢𝘪𝘴𝘺, honestly the only reason I wound up liking the book. Unfortunately, 𝘊𝘢𝘳𝘳𝘪𝘦 𝘚𝘰𝘵𝘰 does not have an emotionally beautiful or painful ending. ⁣
⁣
🤔 I guess some could argue that it does, but 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐢𝐞 makes it really hard to form any sort of emotional attachment to any element of this story.⁣
⁣
Much like I’ve said with other 𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐬𝐭𝐚 darlings like 𝐄𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐲 𝐇𝐞𝐧𝐫𝐲, 𝐂𝐡𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐚 𝐋𝐚𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐧, and 𝐇𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐁𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐤, I don’t think I’ll force myself to pick up another 𝐓𝐉𝐑 book. There’s just not enough going on in 𝐓𝐉𝐑 novels to really keep me hooked. 🤷🏻‍♀️⁣

17908455947124187;"✨Feliz día del Dietista-Nutricionista✨

Hoy es nuestro día y voy con una, posiblemente, #unpopularopinion 

✊🏼Hoy es un día en el que reivindicamos con fuerza nuestra profesión, nuestra visibilidad, nuestro reconocimiento como profesional sanitario y el papel clave que tenemos en la mejora de la Salud Pública. 

Pero yo, hoy, no quiero reivindicar lo mismo que todas. 

Y te contaré por qué:

Justo ayer, casualidades de la vida, vi en Twitter a una estudiante quejarse de la carga lectiva de la asignatura de economía y que habían pasado por la dieta FODMAPS de puntillas. 

Otros días más atrás, le leí a otro compañero que había alguien por ahí haciendo dietas a 10€ la sesión (y sí, al parecer era DN)

Y cada semana, me encuentro en las sesiones de mentorías a dietistas-nutricionistas excelentes, grandes profesionales con un potencial enorme, que tienen miedo a poner precio a sus servicios, no tienen claro a quién se dirigen o no valoran su trabajo (“parece que les cobro por pesarles y medirles”, me escribió una persona hace poco).

Y ya no hablemos de comunicación, de estrategia, de creatividad o mentalidad. 

Hoy, además de reivindicar que los dietistas-nutricionistas tengan un papel relevante en la Sanidad Pública, también reivindico que nos pongamos el gorro de negocio y nos formemos en esta área.

Porque:

1️⃣ Mientras no haya plazas públicas para opositar, hay que buscar trabajo en terceros o emprender (hola, plan de negocio, plan de viabilidad, plan de comunicación, estrategia…) 

2️⃣ No todos queremos un puesto de funcionario (y menos mal) pero, entonces, tenemos que formarnos y aprender las reglas del juego del emprendimiento. 

3️⃣ Hacer una profesión grande también es hacerla rentable y que podamos vivir de ella con calidad de vida (y no tirarnos fines de semanas o noches haciendo pautas personalizadas)

4️⃣ Contra el intrusismo se lucha, también, siendo mejor que los intrusos, a todos los niveles.

✅ Sé que me seguís muchas compañeras que tenéis consulta o proyecto propio, me gustaría saber cómo lidiáis con la parte “no nutricional”, ¿algún aprendizaje?

✨Por una profesión sanitaria de primera, a todos los niveles✨

Feliz noche!";2021-11-24 20:44:48+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:43.468845+00:00;44;304;es

17950634228345543;"Something I've been thinking about posting for a while...
Towards the end of January, I had a tough few weeks with my PhD. Learning new complex experimental techniques, whilst simultaneously learning to code and keeping up with teaching, was rather overwhelming. 
I remember thinking that:
a) I had no idea what was going on
b) I was rubbish at everything 
And 
c) that I did not like my PhD.

Looking back, I can see that I might have been catastrophising slightly. However, nobody warned me that these feelings and experiences are quite normal during a PhD. 
I'm now back on track and am loving my research (for now!)
After chatting with a few friends and hearing similar experiences to my own, it made me reflect on things I wish I'd known before starting this process!

(After my recent discovery of notionhq, I also wish I'd known about how useful it is during my 1st year!)

18008800765373384;"🐢 Book Review 🐢 

Second First Impressions by Sally Thorne

Rating: ⭐️💫 1.5/5

* Genre: contemporary romance 
* Published: April 13, 2021
* Page count: 352

Maybe my expectations were too high going in because of how much I loved The Hating Game, but I was constantly finding myself on the verge of DNFing this book.

I hate to say it, but I thought that the MC Ruthie was incredibly bland. Maybe I would’ve had an easier time connecting with her character if she had some semblance of, I don’t know… a life? She doesn’t go out at all, is a workaholic, and spends every waking hour taking care of a retirement home. As for her love interest Teddy… I personally have a hard time rooting for a guy who is unable to take care of himself. He was a flight risk during the majority of the book, so I was 0% invested in his character. Overall, I wasn’t able to bring myself to root for the two of them.

The only component of this book that kept me engaged were the side characters Melanie, Renata, and Agatha… Their scenes were the only ones I looked forward to, which is problematic given that this is supposed to be a love story. 😅

However, just because this book wasn’t for me doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t give it a try - I know a lot of friends who enjoyed it! I still love Sally Thorne as an author and will most definitely still be reading her next release.";2022-01-02 23:00:38+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:43.468845+00:00;30;1043;en
17888835779713096;"🌠 Catherine House - Elisabeth Thomas

Unpopuläre Meinung: als ich letzte Woche dieses Buch startete, hatte ich keine großen Erwartungen. Es war von all meinen ungelesenen Büchern das mit der schlechtesten Goodreads Bewertung und auch meine liebsten Bookstagramer und Booktuber waren wenig begeistert. Umso überraschter war ich, dass mir das Buch dann doch unerwartet gut gefallen hat. 

Die junge Ines kommt nach Catherine House, einer elitären Universität, die von ihren Student*innen vollkommene Hingabe verlangt und jeglichen Kontakt zur Außenwelt außerhalb der Universität untersagt. Mit der Zeit gewöhnt sich Ines an diese neue Welt und entdeckt einige dunkle Geheimnisse...

Ja, die zwei Hauptkritikpunkte stimmen: alle Personen sind zu 100% unsympathisch und gerade im Mittelteil dümpelt die Geschichte für ca. 50 Seiten vor sich hin. 
Dafür ist aber die Atmosphäre wunderbar. Dark Academia, eine unheimliche, düstere Universität, ohne jeglichen Kontakt zur Außenwelt, dubiose Machenschaften und Charaktere, die nicht bloß schwarz und weiß gezeichnet sind. Das Ende, was vielen nicht gefallen hat, war für mich im übrigen genau richtig so. 
Daher von mir überraschende 4/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

------- 

Unpopular opinion: when I picked up this book last week, I had almost zero expectations. Out of all of my unread books, this one has by far the worst rating on Goodreads and my favorite booktubers and bookstagramers also seem to dislike this novel. This is why I was even more surprised when I genuinely liked this book.

The young student Ines arrives at Catherine House, an old college that demands complete devotion of its students and does not allow any contact with the outside world. Over time, Ines gets used to her new surroundings and reveals some dark secrets...

Two major points of criticism: there is not a single likeable character in this story and especially in the middle part the pacing is a little bit off. 
On the other hand the atmosphere is just marvelous. Dark academia vibes, a gloomy college, a mystery and morally gray characters. Contrary to many other reviewers, I even liked the ending!

18020674465448515;"🇬🇧👇 #unpopularopinion 🙈
Premetto che “Persone normali” è un romanzo abbastanza fuori la mia confort zone, ma i pareri in cui incappavo erano così positivi che mi sono detta “iniziamo l’anno con un libro diverso dal solito”. Mi chiedo perché a volte mi vengano di queste idee xD

Inutile dirvi che “Persone normali” ha deluso le mie aspettative. Non è un libro banale, oltre alla storia d’amore (che comunque fatico ancora a definire tale) affronta argomenti importanti e delicati che fanno da padrone nelle vite di due protagonisti decisamente complessi. Questo libro in effetti ha il pregio di farti vedere chiaramente il mondo attraverso gli occhi di Marianne e Connell… un mondo distorto, loro.

👉 Ho trovato in questi elementi un grande potenziale, l’autrice però non è riuscita a sfruttarlo. “Persone normali” è un romanzo che rimane di superficie, sembra che tutto abbia lo stesso tono e la scrittura estremamente semplice non aiuta a darvi carattere.

Con rammarico devo dire che non mi ha davvero lasciato niente ☹️

🇬🇧 “Normal people” has disappointed my expectations. It is not a trivial book, I found great potential in these elements, but the author was unable to exploit it. It's a novel that remains superficial, everything seems to have the same tone and the extremely simple writing doesn't help give it character.

With regret I have to say that he really left me nothing ☹️
Did you like it or am I really the only one who didn't like it?

But really it, just is what it is, & without excessive exercise & compulsive dieting (aka eating disorders and disordered eating) which are not healthy & could lead to serious health problems. Your body will fight to stay alive LISTEN TO IT!

your body doesn't care what society thinks, it just knows what it needs for the best chance of living as long as possible. 

Reposted from healthyphit You don't have to agree, but our body shape, weight and size are controlled about 85% by genetics. So, the alterations we can achieve with diet and exercise is limited. 

But if you are a person who is able to manipulate your body to a preferred weight range or size and that maintenance requires long-term over-exercising (7 days/week is NOT ideal as our bodies DESERVE and REQUIRE rest days) and under eating (1200 calories is the daily recommendation for toddlers and our brains need that much alone simply to FUNCTION), that is not your body's physiological and genetically preferred weight/size. 

Now, at the end of the day....BODY AUTONOMY. If you believe this regimen is good for you: Do you Boo. But please don't go telling other people to follow suit, because it's NOT healthy or sustainable.

Today’s #ReadWithWeenie is:

The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid 
(swipe for synopsis!)

⭐️⭐️

I gave it an honest shot. I went in feeling positive about this book because I liked Malibu Rising so much. But this brought me back to all the things I didn’t like about Daisy Jones, except worse. 
I want to start by saying I frequently like characters who are “bad” people. I don’t, however, like characters who are constantly admitting to being “not a good person” when what they mean is they literally make the same stupid and immature decisions over and over again. That is a stupid character, and to me, bad writing. 
There were so many things in this book that could have been really deep and insightful, but TJR instead made it feel like a high school drama, with characters who never matured, spread out over 60 years. Stop here if you haven’t read the book yet - just know I think this book is a giant mess - which is why we picked this blooper photo for the post. 😂

⚠️SPOILERS AHEAD!⚠️
First of all, Evelyn doesn’t date anyone. She just immediately marries them and then is shocked when it turned into a disaster. At one point, 4 months after marrying someone she barely knows and who had only ever commented on her beauty and sexuality, she actually says “I thought I could finally have a meaningful marriage”. Lol okay. 
But I understand that her marriages were supposed to be disastrous because she was supposed to be with her true love, but Celia is perhaps the biggest disaster in the story. She acts ridiculously childish, jealous, and incredibly selfish. She blows up, storms out, and says terrible things every time she’s upset. And she never grows up - she leaves Evelyn twice in the same overly dramatic way, never bothering to have an adult conversation. 
I also found the “twist” to be annoying since it wasn’t really a twist and I was already so annoyed with every character so I didn’t care. 
I’m sad to say I think I’m done with TJR. I’ve read three and only liked one.

.
Alright bookstagram.. don’t hate me. I really liked this book but I think I may have wanted to love it too much that I set my expectations too high. And let me preface with this is not a negative review because there was a lot I really liked, I just didn’t LOVE love it ya know?
.
To start I absolutely loved the fake dating mixed with the grumpy and sunshine trope and the writing style. alihazelwood had me audibly laughing through this one and it felt like such a smart play on the cheesy romcom (the jokes on one bed KILLED ME) with some spice. I also really enjoyed the woman in STEM view and how this book captures the concept of being in a woman in a man’s world. I 1000% plan on reading everything else she writes because I really did like it and still definitely recommend it. 
.
With that I was a bit disappointed in the friendships Olive had. I had such an unwanted dislike for Anh as up until the end of the book, I found her self centered and not really there for Olive in all the things she was going through in the ways I felt a true best friend should be. This is a theme I have noticed in other books (cue The Lion’s Den) that can really turn me off from a book I would otherwise LOVE. I just want everyone to be supportive and there for each other and never feeling so alone or that they have to hide things from♥️ 
.
I know Anh was the main driver of a lot of the storyline and hilarious scenes that I loved but it was frustrating that she never seemed to ask Olive about how she was doing and instead assumed or talked about herself. I know that it is such a specific thing to dislike in a book but it hurt my heart and made me angry at Anh almost the entire book which really took away some of the story for me.
.
All that being said I still really enjoyed this one. If you are looking for a spicy, laugh out loud, sarcastic romance, I highly recommend The Love Hypothesis 🔬💕

I find it hard to DNF books or stop a series halfway, especially since they do end up paying off sometimes. Plus I need to know the ending! Which is why I read Finlay Donovan Knocks 'Em Dead even though I didn't love the first book. Sadly I liked this even less.

𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐈 𝐥𝐢𝐤𝐞𝐝:

😎 The last few chapters and epilogue
😎 A reveal I didn't see coming
😎 Finlay and Vero's ride-or-die relationship

𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐈 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐥𝐢𝐤𝐞𝐝:

🥴 Finlay Donovan
🥴 Vero doesn't shine the same
🥴 The story gets increasingly convoluted
🥴 More of the same, but less refreshing
🥴 Nothing that made me wanna keep reading other than wanting to get it off my Netgalley shelf

Note that the story here is a continuation of the first book, with the same recurring characters, so it does not work as a standalone and has to be read in order.

I'm in the minority with this unpopular opinion but I suppose it's hard to love a book when you don't even like the titular character. I won't go into why here but my full review is on Goodreads.

⁣
That's the only thing I kept thinking as I read 𝐑𝐚𝐳𝐨𝐫𝐛𝐥𝐚𝐝𝐞 𝐓𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬. And it took me over a week to read this book. That's a long time to have this little-known Jojo song running through my mind. 🤷🏻‍♀️⁣
⁣
So... this book gets a lot of hype.⁣
⁣
Did I like it? Mostly yes.⁣
⁣
Did I love it? No.⁣
⁣
Buddy Lee & Ike flip their scripts real fast when their sons die. They spent their whole lives shaming their gay sons, but the minute they die, they realize the error of their ways? Not so believable.⁣
⁣
Then, newly changed, they revert back to their old jail-bound ways and go on a killing spree to avenge their sons' deaths. Yes, I'm sure that's exactly what their sons would have wanted.⁣
⁣
I'm of the minority here, but I didn't find this book to be ""beautiful"" as many reviews say it is.⁣
⁣
Ya know what would have been beautiful? If this book focused on Derek and Isiah. If it focused on their love story, their triumphs despite having homophobic fathers. Instead of focusing on those homophobic fathers. 🤷🏻‍♀️⁣
⁣
And the violence in this... I'm not a fan of descriptive violence just for the sake of it, and there was SO MUCH of it here. I'm really just not seeing the ""beauty"" of it all.⁣

📗The Last House on Needless Street, by Catriona Ward⁠
👈🏼SYNOPSIS: Swipe left⁠
.⁠
✍🏼MY THOUGHTS: Coming in hot with an unpopular opinion on this one. I know that bookstagram is l-o-v-i-n-g this one, but unfortunately it just wasn't for me. ⁠
I found myself painfully bored with this one. It was a slug to get through, and honestly I guessed what was going on with our main character, Ted, not even a quarter of the way into the book. His character actually reminded me of a movie and I immediately figured that's what was going on, but I won't name that movie because as everyone says, it would spoil the twist and I don't want to do that.⁠
Now, I will say that his book was well written; just because I was bored by it, doesn't mean it's a bad book. It's a slow burn, and if you didn't figure out what was going on, I can definitely see how the ending would blind side you and you'd love it. I would never discourage you from reading this one, it just simply didn't do it for me.";2022-01-31 13:34:24+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:43.484466+00:00;14;740;en

The Fine Print
By: Lauren Asher
⭐️⭐️⭐️

First off - I have major respect for anyone that can write an entire book because Lord knows I could never! Also, just because this book may not have been for me doesn’t mean it’s not for someone else.

Now, I know this book is beloved on Booksta so no one come for me for this one, but this book just did not do it for me. The last about 15% was good, but I wasn’t the biggest fan of everything leading up to that point. 

It was a lot of telling me, over and over, that the MMC was the grump and the FMC was the sunshine in this grumpy/sunshine trope. I prefer books to be more showing and less telling - if that makes any sense. I think it could’ve been such a stronger book if the trope was more intuitive and displayed through the characters actions/mannerisms. 

I love me some good Disney vibes, which this book had, and the ending was great! But overall just wasn’t for me. 

Even though this one wasn’t my fav I’ll probably end up reading the second book in the series because I have serious FOMO and seeing everyone talk about it makes me want to read it 😂

What’s your most unpopular book opinion?? I need to know!";2022-03-18 17:01:05+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:43.500054+00:00;41;0;en

Todo el mundo quiere estar cerca de los famosos hermanos Riva: Nina, la talentosa surfista y supermodelo; Jay y Hud, un campeón del surf y un conocido fotógrafo respectivamente; y la adorada Kit, la más joven de la familia. Los cuatro hermanos despiertan auténtica fascinación tanto en Malibú como en el resto del mundo, especialmente por ser los descendientes del legendario cantante Mick Riva.

✨Combina el presente de los hermanos Riva y el pasado con flashbacks donde conocemos a Mick Riva y June.
✨Novela centrada en los personajes y no en la trama como tal, lo que me ha fallado, ya que esperaba mucho más de esta historia.
✨Eso sí, personajes con fondo y muy bien construidos.
✨Historia sencilla.
✨Narración y ambientación 🔝

17925451672870718;"DOUBLE TAP if you’re ready to STOP letting what *they* say dictate what you THINK or how you ACT + If you’re struggling with that - remember these 5 things:⁣
⁣
1️⃣What others think really isn’t your business anyways⁣
⁣
The ONLY way that another persons thoughts (or voiced opinions) can get to you is if you ALLOW them to. So whether they have said something out loud or you just *THINK* they’re judging you - it’s ultimately up to you if you will have that be the loudest say in your mind. ⁣
⁣
2️⃣Know that you’re value is not contingent on being liked or accepted⁣
⁣
This one is HARD, but you have to remember that ultimately your value doesn’t come from what THEY think of you (again whether voiced or not). It truly has ZERO impact on your infinite value as a human being, remember that. ⁣
⁣
Talking about values, ⁣
⁣
3️⃣You have to define your values⁣
⁣
If you’re living just to please other people or what *YOU THINK* will please other people, THAT IS EXHAUSTING. Instead try focusing on defining what VALUES are most important to you. Focus on WHO you want to be - not what others say you should be. Focus on what’s IMPORTANT to you, not what others think should be important to you. Once you have defined your values, it’s A LOT easier to align yourself with other like-minded people and not let others oPiNiOnS affect you so much. ⁣
⁣
⁣
4️⃣Dig DEEPER & ask yourself what’s really happening⁣
⁣
We all have a past and failures on repeat or stories we’ve told ourselves for years that can easily be triggered by another persons opinion of us. If you find yourself in that spot, you have to identify, what deeper wound is being triggered by that persons opinion of you. It’s easy to write a new story once you’ve identified the old story you’ve been telling yourself. ⁣
⁣
5️⃣Give yourself GRACE & move on ⁣
⁣
We’re human, we will allow peoples opinions to dictate some actions - BUT the key is to identify it be PRO-ACTIVE & aware when it’s happening. The journey of not allowing others opinions to affect us is not something thats immediately be solved overnight, but OVERTIME with intentional actions you can & will be able to let their voice slowly fade away.⁣

by Rivers Solomon

Sooooooooo…

At the beginning of this book I had no idea what to expect. It started off a little crazy but I had an inkling it was going to be really interesting. Suspension of disbelief was needed almost right away, which I thought was strange as I didn’t know this was going to have any paranormal elements.

But then everything went sideways. The story ran in a completely different direction than I expected. I thought Vern and her two babies would be the central characters but there was much of the book where the kids didn’t figure in at all.

And then the paranormal elements became even stranger.

After taking a step back, I can see how the author related horrible transgressions of the US Govt towards people of color into these paranormal events. I can appreciate the hidden meanings. But the storyline was just so crazy, the character bounced around and changed so much that I couldn’t follow the arc.

I just didn’t really enjoy it from a story perspective. I’m sure it’s a brilliant work of art, and it’s received a few awards, it just was not an enjoyable read for entertainment for me personally.

Q: What’s a book you’ve read that you didn’t connect with but is an award winning book or just super popular?

Unpopular opinion 😬

I finally DNF a book this year. Holly Black’s debut novel for adults, Book of Night happened to be the one. I tried to read it already during summer but I DNF’d it then, and thought perhaps I can give it another try. So I did and the result was the same. 

I just couldn’t push through. I think the concept is interesting but it was slow and confusing. Sure, the novel is for adult audience but describing adult life like paying your own bills, living with a partner were just a waste of time. 😩 I felt no charisma from the characters either. 

Sorry folks, especially to the ones who liked the book but I stand by my opinion. 

Have a great Friday everyone! 🥰.

Does my face say it all? I think I may have an unpopular opinion.  I am not sure what I expected going into this one, it was my first Sager book and it was super hyped up.  Did I get a suspenseful ride?  I did, at times.  Did I see the ending coming? Once again, yes I did.  It was just a gut feeling, that sometimes the least obvious is the most obvious, right?  Because what is right in front of your face is never as it appears.

Like any good horror movie, if we are not screaming at the protagonist about how stupid they are, we probably wouldn’t enjoy it all. This did not fail in that area.  Charlie ignored every red flag possible.  And I mean every one!  First of all who in their right mind decides to ride across the country with a complete stranger? The whole thing was over the top for me.  I guess maybe because I would never do what she did to find myself in that position, it was hard for me to relate. 

Did I like any of it you may ask? I did. I loved all the references to the the old movies, that was a fun spin.  And I loved the ending.  The epilogue, I suppose.  Those 3 pages were my favorite of the whole book.  Would I recommend it? MMMM….not sure.  Will I try another Sager book? I certainly will.

✍️ It’s about to get rant-y up in here! As soon as I finished this book I posted a story about how the twist is a complete rip-off of a very popular movie that was made two years prior. I know none of you believed me and tried to convince me otherwise (except for bookish_bruja) but I stand strong! This story is completely unoriginal and I read the acknowledgements twice to see if credit was given to the movie, but nope. I also went down a very long Google rabbit hole and while some reviewers acknowledge that this book and said movie are similar, for whatever reason they’re not mad about it. I know what you’re thinking: it’s me. I’m the crazy one.

However MOST of the time I work with people who have been so brainwashed into think they have to eat 1200 calories or less because that’s what a magazine or god forbid, myfitnesspal told them. 

1200 calories is enough to feed my 4 month old puppy and a toddler, NOT A GROWN ASS ADULT. 

Eat more = lose weight.

17956613356683158;"BOOK REVIEW //⁠
⭐️⭐️⭐️.25⁠
📖The People We Keep, by Allison Larkin⁠
👈🏼SYNOPSIS: Swipe left⁠
.⁠
✍🏼MY THOUGHTS: Okay folks, don’t hate me for this unpopular opinion, but this book just wasn’t it for me. And I know that almost damn near all of you loved it, and trust me, I love that for you, but I just didn’t get the hype.⁠
Now because I believe in being positive and kind, let’s talk about what did work. Great writing. I thought Larkin wrote beautifully and told April’s story with rawness and honesty.⁠
I also really loved the message of finding your own family. I’ve always been a believer that the people you love don’t have to be blood, but instead they are the people who love you unconditionally and will fight for you (and with you when you need it). Those people come into our lives in so many different ways.⁠
But despite all that, I just found the story…boring. I kept waiting for that “a-ha! This is why they all love it!” moment that just never came. It didn’t tug on my heart strings and I was just so thankful it was a quick read because I wanted the boredom to end.⁠
So there we have it. My first hyped book that fell flat for me of 2022. It happens to us all and onto the next!⁠

“A Thousand Steps” - T. Jefferson Parker

☮️ SYNOPSIS: It’s described as a gripping thriller, an incisive coming-of-age story, and a vivid portrait of a turbulent time and place in California, 1968.

☮️ REVIEW: Yall, I rarely pre-order books, but this was one I was SO hyped for because I am alllll about a novel that will give me the 60s vibes. I live for that era of music and learning more about that time period, so give it to me. But this..

It’s described as a gripping thriller and I don’t think that could be anything further than the truth. A gripping dose of melatonin might be a bit more fitting. I was very confused on the genre here, because there is absolutely nothing that has you on the edge of your seat. Ok, there is a murder, and someone goes missing - but the way the book focuses on the missing girl’s brother and his damn paper route makes you forget all about what’s going on there. Seriously, this book should have been titled “Matt on a Bike” instead of “A Thousand Steps,” because there was no stepping - it was just this kid riding his bike everywhere!!!

And hey, I LOVE a good coming of age story, but this was marketed as a THRILLER. And if we are even evaluating this on coming of age, that was lacking. 

THE POSITIVE: I did like the 60s time period descriptors, so I feel like the author did a good job of describing the setting. Even including major historical events such as the Vietnam War, you had no doubt what time period you were in, so here I was not disappointed.

☮️ VERDICT: 2 STARS ⭐️⭐️

The Measure

Author: Nikki Erlick
Genre:  Contemporary Fiction

Swipe for the Goodreads synopsis ⬅️ 

Unpopular opinion alert 🫣 I didn’t like this book…None of the characters really stood out or caught my attention and everything was very slow paced which I rarely enjoy. 

I think the main issue for me is that this was primarily contemporary fiction (a genre I don’t usually enjoy) with a dash of sci-fi (the strings)…one of my main qualms was that the strings were never explained, which I’m sure could be the point, it just didn’t work for me personally.

All in all, I thought the premise was so interesting! If I had the option to know how much longer I had left in life, I don’t think I would want to know!? Would you look at your string to find out how long your life would be??";2023-01-23 18:08:05+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:47.269077+00:00;20;237;en

If you know there is stuff to release, it is good to sit down and reflect on it.

Genbu is notoriously known as the most difficult synthV voicebank to work with, especially his Lite vb. I’ve seen people complain about his range being too limited, his vb quality being bad and his voice just sounding unpleasant in general. I am a beginner synthV user (I’ve only used Eleanor forte lite before) and I decided to try Genbu lite for the shits and giggles but I was pleasantly surprised! He does have a limited range but with the right voice settings he actually sounds pretty good! Plus him being the only male vb with a free lite version I think people should be more open to trying him, if a beginner like me can make him sound decent a more experienced synthV user could make him do wonders

Those are just the ones I can think of, but I’m certain there’s more. It just doesn’t make sense to me why there’s so many children vocaloids when real kid singers are far and few between. Seriously, name a child vocalist under 16 who is popular right now. There are none, right? I thought this would be like, a Japan thing because of idol girl groups tending to be younger girls, but even that’s a stretch considering it’s a GROUP of girls and not just a single child.

📖 LC de Noël du #darkbookclub (choix de nessa.booknlove) 📖

💬 Mon avis - Non. Non. Non. 💬

Hello les ami.e.s!

Une fois n'est pas coutume et comme demandé en story, je vous livre mon avis à chaud sur ma dernière lecture, ""finie"" hier soir. Pourquoi les guillemets? Parce que pour la première fois de ma vie de lectrice, j'ai fait l'impasse sur une grande partie du bouquin, en l’occurrence des pages 70 à 220 (sur 313 en tout). Et le pire, c'est que ça ne m'a pas empêchée de comprendre ce qui se passait!

Ma lecture avait pourtant bien commencé. Le style était agréable à lire, le décor se plantait tranquillement. Mais ça c'était avant le drame page 36. La scène décrite à ce moment-là m'a fait atterrir sans transition dans une très mauvaise comédie romantique de Noël sur TF1 (les comédies Netflix ne vont pas aussi bas) ou un roman Harlequin souffreteux, au choix (oui, vous avez bien lu!).

Le second coup de massue est venu des personnages principaux. Que ce soit la belle et gentille Alice ou sa sœur Romy la borderline, elles m'ont toutes les deux exaspéré, la première par sa mièvrerie et l'autre par son égoïsme extrême. Certes, ce genre d'opposition fait tout le sel d'un thriller psychologique mais le trait m'a paru tellement forcé que j'ai décidé de passer directement à la quasi-fin du roman, d'autant que je voyais venir le dénouement à des kilomètres.

Et bien m'en a pris! Enfin, dans le sens où je me suis épargné la lecture de ce qui me serait apparu comme une ""pseudo ambiance effrayante"" saupoudrée des clichés habituels et que pour autant, j'ai pu reconstituer ce qui s'était passé dans les pages non lues. Et alors la chute de toute cette histoire mes ami.e.s! Mon dieu... Elle a fini de l'achever à mes yeux! Pour moi, le manque de crédibilité total est ce qui caractérise le nœud de l'intrigue et sa chute. Je ne peux pas en dire plus sous peine de spoiler mais sachez que ce qui est mort à Noël, ce sont mes espoirs dans ce roman.

Si vous l'avez lu et aimé, dites-le moi en commentaires, qu'on échange dessus!

“I’ve found life much sweeter when I choose to believe the best of others, rather than the worst.”

I’m coming at you on this Monday with a very unpopular opinion 🙈 I bought this book quite a while back after seeing SO many 5 star reviews for it and I chose it as a book to read with my IRL besties sure that it would be a hit…unfortunately for me, it was a miss. 

The second-born daughters of the Fontana family are cursed to never find love. In The Star-Crossed Sisters of Tuscany a trio of these second-born daughters set out to break this curse on a journey through Italy. It had promise, it really did! The idea of nice family adventure, finding love, defying the odds, traveling throughout Italy, I was here for it! Unfortunately to me it just felt very soap opera-y. I had SO many issues with most of the characters, Emilia was boring and let her mean old grandma dictate her life, her sister was rude and the explanation for it wasn’t worth it, and don’t even get me started on Rosa. But I was still hanging in there until the “twist” came. I won’t spoil it for y’all who haven’t read it yet but it was wildly unbelievable and included so much gaslighting that I was furious. AND she never even apologized OR had to own up to it because after Emilia found out she STILL kept the secret?! No, thank you!! 

I’ve rated it 2⭐️s - it was okay. I enjoyed Poppy and Rico’s story and the descriptions of Italy. Every other character/plot line gets no love from me. The audiobook narration was good, so I’d recommend that if you’re going to read it. Like I said, I know sooo many people who loved this book so just keep in mind if you’re going to pick it up that I’m in the minority here. 

💭If you’ve read it, what were your thoughts?";2021-11-08 17:00:20+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:47.269077+00:00;32;801;en

I’m a bit scared to post my review of this as it is loved by so many! I read this as the final 2022 pick for bookclubdinostar and loved hearing everybody else rave about it and feel so connected to the story and the characters. I also really enjoyed seeing Tina’s impressive collection of Addie editions. Unfortunately, it just didn’t seem to connect for me in the same way.

The novel is set primarily in 18th century France and 21st century New York. It follows Addie (Adeline) who, on the eve of an unwanted arranged marriage, strikes a deal with a dark god for a free and everlasting life in exchange for her soul when she is done. However it turns out there is a catch (obviously, it’s a deal with the devil after all) - as soon as she is out of sight, people forget she exists.

I found this novel incredibly slow and it seems to consist of descriptions of Addie’s very repetitive life with minimal contribution to the plot. It bugged me how she barely matured over the course of 300 years and we never saw her experimenting with her ‘freedom’, only struggling with its limits. There were occasional meet ups between Addie and the dark god (Luc/Lucifer) which I think were supposed to have some romantic tension but they barely spoke to each other and seemed to have no meaningful connection beyond their stubbornness. Incidentally shared stubbornness seems to be a popular theme in book relationships but I’m really not sure it is so ubiquitous in real life. There was another love interest introduced in the final third of the book who was so insipid and wet that I struggled to see why anybody would care about him. Once again his and Addie’s relationship consisted of shared frustration rather than any actual good chat or common ground.

I think I’m in the minority on this one but it’s not going on my recommended list just yet…";2022-12-21 19:36:23+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:47.269077+00:00;16;59;en

She vows to do whatever it takes to avenge her beloved sister, Vittoria… even if that means accepting the hand of the Prince of Pride, the king of demons.

The first rule in the court of the Wicked? Trust no one. With back-stabbing princes, luxurious palaces, mysterious party invitations, and conflicting clues about who really killed her twin, Emilia finds herself more alone than ever before. Can she even trust Wrath, her one-time ally in the mortal world… or is he keeping dangerous secrets about his true nature?

Emilia will be tested in every way as she seeks a series of magical objects that will unlock the clues of her past and the answers she craves…

ID: The Kingdom of the Wicked and Cursed books surrounded by Cece's sweater, pumpkins, plants, mason jar, twine with the pre-order enamel pin for KOW, and candles.

🔘easy but choppy reading - a lot of this happened and that happened ⁣
🔘lots and lots and lots of tennis - I played this match.. I won this match … blah blah . In 82 pages she became the greatest tennis player in the world but like really nothing much actually happened in those pages ; the second half was no different - just tennis match after tennis match for the most part with a little bit of other stuff … 🥱 ⁣
🔘generally throughout the book I felt no real emotion or connection to any of the characters⁣
✔️ I actually thought the ending was good and enjoyed the characters of NickiChan and Bowe Huntley⁣

This is my second book by this author and really the other one was just ok. I know she’s very popular but maybe just not for me.⁣

17945710799187802;"ppl r starting to compare AI synths to AI art and idk how people can even think the two are the same. first, AI voicebanks are legal. The voice providers authorize the production and selling of the product, get paid and are fully aware of what they're doing. Kafu's voice provider didn't want her voicebank to sound like her so she got pitched up. Would AI nerds respect artists like this? AI vbs aren't perfect and still need human manipulation, or they'll sound monotone as hell. Vocalochanger does not train on what recordings we give it. It does not learn to become more and more efficient, only Yamaha can do that, and it's bad. It can work perfectly only if you have dry, crispy and high quality audios, but ive tried countless acapellas from real celebrities and they all sound like shit/mediocre. Also u cant edit vocalochanger audios. Once its done, you cant edit the tuning. What does AI art do? Steal w no authorization, try to sell the art, disregard artists and try to take their place

Another somewhat #unpopularopinion 🤷‍♀️ ⁣
⁣
✔️this is a book about women’s reproductive rights and forced sterilizations performed on poor/ uneducated/disabled women - especially Black and other minorities⁣
✔️the writing is easy and it’s a pretty fast read ⁣
But ….⁣
✖️ I expected this story would tear at my heartstrings (it’s really not that difficult these days) but I really didn’t connect much with it.⁣
✖️I didn’t like the choice of narrator - Civil was a “saviour” and the whole story was told from her perspective. I wanted to hear the family’s perspective, or even the other nurses. ⁣
✖️the budding love story also didn’t sit well with me. I don’t think it was needed 🤷‍♀️ ⁣
✔️I would recommend this book - it’s an important story ⁣

🍁🍁🍁⁣
Inspired by true events that rocked the nation, a searing and compassionate new novel about a Black nurse in post-segregation Alabama who blows the whistle on a terrible injustice done to her patients.⁣
Montgomery, Alabama, 1973. Fresh out of nursing school, Civil Townsend intends to make a difference, especially in her African American community.⁣
But when her first week on the job takes her along a dusty country road to a worn-down one-room cabin, Civil is shocked to learn that her new patients, Erica and India, are children—just eleven and thirteen years old. Neither of the Williams sisters has even kissed a boy, but they are poor and Black, and for those handling the family’s welfare benefits, that’s reason enough to have the girls on birth control. As Civil grapples with her role, she takes India, Erica, and their family into her heart. Until one day she arrives at their door to learn the unthinkable has happened, and nothing will ever be the same for any of them.⁣

Don’t get me wrong, I love Mr Darcy - as portrayed by Colin Firth - as much as the next Janeite. But when it comes to female protagonists, Emma Woodhouse is the one for me. She has a real character arc, shedding some of her flaws and coming out the other end as a much better person. At the same time, Mr. Knightly loves her just as she is, warts and all. 

By contrast, Elizabeth Bennett seems to very much stay the same. Yes, she changes her opinion of Mr. Darcy but only because he is actually a good man and she got the wrong end of the stick.

Sustainable packaging isn't for everyone. 

Did you know that compostable mailer bags have an expiry date? We didn't.⁠
⁠
While we started with big hopes and goals, like any other business, we soon learnt that we weren't ready to support a sustainable packaging option until our orders increased.⁠
⁠
Unfortunately the reality of being a small micro business means that we can not all afford to invest in ideal sustainability options until the business has grown consistently anywhere up to 3 years.⁠
⁠
In the mean time, we have a new goal to utilise our current sustainable mailers before they expire. #liveandlearn⁠

•••
Of all the spots I’ve passed in Vietnam this was my everywhere alltime happy place when not riding: at some local road resto drinking a delicious strong pitstop coffee.

Haven’t done much of active trips or sightseeing, but honestly I came for the ride but not necessarily for the country. The riding adventure and the views and experiences during the rides were the best part for me.

Although I’ve definitely done and seen some amazing things which I could absolutely appreciate, but there just wasn’t a spark between me and Nam.

At one hand it was epic because I’ve seen and done things I’ve never seen or done before. But not all things I have seen and experienced made me happy. Instead they made me sad and frustrated and wanting to go home. And I’m not talking about the challenging routes or weather. I would say it’s the cultural differences that mostly made me feel that way.

In conclusion: Vietnam is just not the country for me and I don’t expect to come back ever again. And that’s totally fine. It’s actually the 2nd time in my whole travelling life I conclude this. The 1st destination I unexpectedly did not fall in love with and made me homesick was Hawaii, as crazy as it my sound.

Anyway… I thank you greatly Vietnam for having me and for letting me check off my bucketlist item.

18171682615251534;"Let's play a game 🎲
Would you rather having a friendly supportive boss or a strict and scary one?

Would you rather having parents with great communication skill or with a dictatorship style?

The last one,
Would you rather being able to enjoy living your life or to obey any obligation you got?

The answers are how I see Allah SWT

I despise someone if I'm scared of them, no matter how much they contribute to my entire life. Why would I owe something to someone that I'm afraid of in the first place? 🤷🏻‍♀

I can't resist to rebel if I face any kind of system that block me from living my life (this is the main reason I chose English Literature instead of Pendidikan Bahasa Inggris)

No doubt, I definitely choose to enjoy our short and temporary life while making any obligation that I have seems so much fun to do

For me Allah SWT is my bestie. My everything. He has my respect. He has my faith. He has all of me. He is my home.

Obligations as a muslim:
Shalat? It's not a prayer, it's a heart to heart meeting and also a break for any tiring activity throughout the whole day.

Sedekah? It's not only good on friday, it's a way to share my happiness or to get in a great mood.

Read Quran? It's not to get pahala or go to Jannatul Firdaus, it's for the cure, the peace, the guide of all my problems.

Wear Hijab? It's not to wrap my aurat, it's to avoid any kind of fitnah and turns out it is also keeping my hair smooth and my body clean 🥰

I know exactly the function of having food for my body, at the right time and the right portion. So does shalat, sedekah, quran, etc.

I don't bother about surga neraka, nothing I can do about it.

What I can do right now is looking for meaning of what Allah has said then implementing it into my daily routine.

That way I live joyfully with no burden, no obligation, no expectation because His direction drives me to my dream life whether it is now (surprisingly) or later in the hereafter 🥰

#unpopularopinion this should've been a trilogy. Honestly the first 3 books were great, small issues with them which is why I couldn't give it a full 5 stars.

The last 3 books, made me reconsider if I was reading the same series. I absolutely hated the following:

1. No one died, where is the consequence? Where do we worry our favourite character will die?

2. The whole memory wipe thing is absolute BS. Where were the planted seeds in the first few books - that this was commonly used or is even a possibility!

3. The previous timeline makes absolutely no sense when Juliette/Ella met Aaron AND Adam.

4. Is Paris Anderson even dead? 😂 Really this became an absolute joke. 

5. The plots of the story that I wanted more of were like 5 pages max. The parts where she's losing her mind or is asleep or doing nothing go on for like 100 pages 👍🏻 - not for me.

6. What happened to the world at the end? Who is running what? 

7. ARE YOU ACTUALLY HAVING A SODDING LAUGH THAT WE DIDN'T GET TO READ ABOUT THE WEDDING?!?! The only decent part about this book was Aaron and Juliette/Ella. 🤦‍♀️

The only good parts:

1. Kenji 😂
2. Juliette/Ella and Aaron 💗
3. Emmaline controls what everyone sees (great plot twist) - environment not as bad as it was made out.
4. Kenji and Aaron

Aw, poop. 

I was so looking forward to this one, and while sometimes the let down is from too high expectations, this time, I think this one just missed the mark for me. 

I just genuinely didn’t like Addie and Dylan’s relationship -  it felt like one of those relationships that you are supposed to learn from and then move forward, versus it being an end-game relationship.  Honestly, I think I would have preferred the HEA ending to be around getting answers, healing, closure, and then moving forward independently, or as just friends - sorry, I just realized that’s kind of a spoiler (whoops), but I feel like it’s kinda a given once you read the synopsis. 

I quite liked Addie, but I didn’t really warm to Dylan in the same way.  Maybe it’s because the trope of rich-boy-meets-frugal/practical-girl isn’t one that really does it for me.  But, I really enjoyed the addition of Dylan’s poetry fragments that he offered throughout the story - it was a unique addition, and it did offer some insight into his character. 

I truly ʟᴏᴀᴛʜᴇᴅ Marcus, and did not find any redeeming qualities - I am not down to support toxic relationships of any sort, just because of some half-assed apologies - smells like manipulation to me folks.  However, I loved Deb, and found her very refreshing in the mix of cast of characters, and I also kind of really enjoyed Rodney, despite the deep error of his ways. 

Ultimately, I think the concept of happily-ever-after really needs a facelift, and wished for it in this book in particular.  But, this wasn’t a bad read, just not what I’d hoped, and I certainly won’t hesitate to pick up O’Leary’s next book.

This was one of my anticipated reads for this year.⁣
⁣
However, while I really enjoyed this author’s debut novel, The Silent Patient, this one fell a bit flat for me .⁣
⁣
✔️ the best part of the book was the appearance of a character from the Silent Patient - unexpected, but enjoyable. It left me wanting to read that book again⁣
✖️the first 26% of the book didn’t really even feel like a M/T but sappy woman’s fiction and not a good one at that l I was tempted to DNF it more than once⁣
✖️it felt like every one in the book had “hidden anger “ issues and Mariana was “glad to get away from them “ 🤷‍♀️ ⁣
✖️the ending just made on sense - seemed to be trying to be sensational- like the ending of The Silent Patient - but just kinda fell flat and came out of nowhere ⁣

17917422485209642;"None of these are aimed at anyone in particular but are just thoughts I’ve had over the years. 
1. I’m so tired of the hard keeper argument. Horses, like humans, thrive on marginally different diets. It is our job as responsible owners to understand each horse’s specific dietary needs and a fat horse does not always mean a healthy horse. 
2. If a rescue is taking donations, buying horses at auctions, dramatizing a sob story from something not that serious, and then “rehoming” horses for similar amounts as they’d sell in the regular market…. That’s not rescue. Growing up I worked for a true rescue that took in humane cases that involved law enforcement. Serious neglect or abuse cases. Rescue has been bastardized into something really… weird for lack of a better term. Just purchasing a horse at an auction doesn’t make it automatically a rescue and just because it’s flighty or lacks training doesn’t mean it was abused. 
3. Good horsemanship requires a lot of education for the HUMAN as well as understanding of the horse on the ground before a saddle is even brought into the picture. I’ve seen many people who are excellent riders but know essentially nothing about horse anatomy/physiology, behavioral science, etc. It’s our job to make sure our horses are as happy and healthy as possible and that usually starts way before the barn door even. It can start in a library, on YouTube, or other sources of education.

17934258349934551;"I love whiskey, but didn't like this book 😬 

Coming in on this #fightmefriday with an unpopular opinion. Every single person I know who has read this book talks about how it's the most emotional book they've read and how they love it. And we know I love an emotional read so I was excited for it. 

But... I didn't feel any emotional connection or tug from this book. Not a dang thing. It was well written, it just didn't touch my soul. I was bored. I thought B and Jamie weren't soulmates with poor timing, but rather toxic people who just couldn't move on. 

I feel like this book might be like The Notebook where people absolutely love the romantic story but maybe years later realize how kinda problematic the whole thing is. Or maybe I'm a cynic 😂

Naturally I appreciate all the whiskey talk,  but that was pretty much it for me. I typically love pining but this missed the mark. 

Am I the only reader who wasn't into this one???

Title: It All Comes Down To This
Author: Teresa Anne Fowler
Genre: Women’s Fiction 
Publisher: St. Martin’s Press
Pub Date: 6/7/22

#QOTD: What is a recent book that missed the mark for you? 

***Contains Spoilers***

It All Comes Down To This by Therese Anne Fowler is the exhausted story plot you hoped to never read again. 

Three sisters must come together to sell their mothers Maine home after she passes away from cancer. The sisters aren’t particularly close so when they come together to get the house ready to go on the market a lot of skeletons come out of the closet. The problem is the sisters are written as stereotypical one dimensional characters. The Type A oldest sister who leads everyone to believe her life is picture perfect though her marriage is failing. The doctor middle sister who tries way too hard to stand out and seek acceptance. The wayward younger sister who never grows up and is perpetually broke and/or homeless despite her influencer lifestyle. 

The biggest issue with the book, beyond its unoriginal plot, is that the characters are lackluster and boring. I couldn’t connect to them which meant I didn’t care where they landed at the end. 

Also, the idea that the 14 year old middle sister pines for her older sister’s husbands so much that it not only ruined her marriage (as an adult), but that she ended up with him, was creepy. 

Overall this story fell flat for me. It was too long, too much of a stereotype and too boring. 

I appreciate the access to the eARC so I could give an honest review. Thank you NetGalley, Macmillan Audio & the author.

“Shiver” - Allie Reynolds

❄️ SYNOPSIS: Five friends gather for a reunion at a French Alps resort where their friend and fellow snowboard competitor, Saskia, disappeared ten years ago.

❄️ REVIEW: Let me give you a heads up - this is probably going to be an unpopular opinion. 

This book should have been titled “Snowboarding” instead, because I feel like that’s all I damn read about. If I ever hear the word “Crippler,” “720,” “540,” or any of the other snowboarding terms they used in this book, it will be too soon.

I thought this would give me the suspense and thrill of “In My Dreams I Hold a Knife” as we have old friends gathering for a reunion after someone went messing/killed, but this did not. It reminded me of “Scream” or 90s horror movies in the fact that these characters were so damn dumb and consistently made idiotic decisions. “Oh, someone is out to get us? We may die?” and these mofos say f it and go snowboarding! WEEEEEEE ⛷🎿⛷

I felt like the same conversation was being had the entire book and we kept going back to it over and over. None of the cast was likeable, which I typically don’t mind if the book was good, but this one was not.

Did I predict the ending? Yes. And I have that on record with thrillofthepage. 

Regardless of all this, I could still see me reading another book by the author, because I think that there is more to come, but this was just not it.

I did like the wintery atmosphere, so if you’re looking for a holiday thriller, you could check this out. Like I said, I think the author could do more in the future.

❄️ VERDICT: TWO STARS ⭐️⭐️

17905508330349023;"TGIF!! 🥂

It's been a minute since I've read a book that I didn't like. I've been on an awesome streak lately! I was due for a dud, but I'm surprised that it was this book. I have seen The Inheritance Games all over the place lately and thought it sounded like a fun read. Almost every review I've seen of it has been 5 stars, so I had high hopes. Unfortunately, I was unmoved. This a YA book, so I wasn't expecting much steam or romance, but it had a weird teenage love triangle that was awkward and just didn't work. I also was expecting more action and suspense, but never really got it. 

Some positives: It is a really quick read, has an interesting premise, and a nice little twist at the end. I know I'm in the minority here. Maybe you'll love it!

chuckyisreal has sat as top doll since his debut in 1988. 

I hear these rumblings and rumours that meetm3gan may have dethroned the iconic slasher, so... I went off to make my own mind up. 

Chucky is a legend of horror in the same league as Jason Voorhees of Freddy Krueger. While M3GAN was OK, it was not the groundbreaking movie people would have you to believe.

Instead, we got a rehash of the 2019 Child's Play remake (which is fine), and I like the AI concept.

But to compare these 2 characters in quality, story or overall influence to Horror  is insanity. The only thought I have is that the younger generation is more scared of AI than Voodoo...

Chucky is King, and at best, M3GAN is the entertaining jester in the corner!

Put these 2 up against each other. There is only one winner!

Ice Planet Barbarians 
Author: Ruby Dixon 

Rating:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.💫

What I Liked:
🚀 Georgie is one stubborn girl and that automatically makes me love her as a MC. Also, she’s not dumb and flat out calls herself out for having Stockholm Syndrome (so did Belle and we love her anyway!). 

🚀If I was unconscious, I could certainly think of worse ways to be waken up. 😏 

🚀I mean who would expect 7 foot tall blue aliens with horns and tails to be soft, gentle, and passionate heroes that you can’t help but fall in love with. Certainly not me, but I don’t hate it. 💙

What I Didn’t Like:
🚀Little Green men from outer space totally freak me out. Also major consent issues throughout the entire series. And let’s not even get started about all the bodily functions that are described. 🤢 

Final Thoughts: 
🚀Listen, I KNOW! I KNOW! 🤦🏻‍♀️ But honestly, maybe it’s all the commercials for Avatar that have been on tv lately, I was in the right mood to read this series. I blinked and had read 2 1/2 in less than a day. Am I proud? No. Will I continue reading? Yes!

I read the it girl book of the season. She’s sleek, she’s cool, she’s hot, but honestly??? I didn’t love it… and that’s okay. She’s probably too cool for me anyway. Still the prettiest book in town. 

I think I’m just burnt out from short story collections to be honest. I only ever like a couple and then I lose interest, get distracted, find myself just trying to finish instead of actually enjoying. It’s tough for me to stay engaged with short stories, and that’s a me problem.  I understand the hype in her writing in general, but it’s just the the mood for me right now lol. IM SORRY ❤️ Still recommended for the creative writing, amazing themes, and if you’re just in the mood for a weird lil short story collection.

Mi chiedo: al giorno d’oggi noi donne per essere sul palco del festival di Sanremo dobbiamo per forza essere portavoce di grandi temi quali emancipazione, razzismo, diritti, affermazione di sè?
Che senso ha essere chiamate co-conduttrici se poi l’unico ruolo che si ha, è quello di stare su un palco, sorridere, emozionarsi e leggere monologhi dopo la mezzanotte? Perché non possiamo essere sul palco dell’Ariston perché sappiamo condurre, cantare, ballare e intrattenere? Potrei fare un elenco lunghissimo di donne che condurrebbero Sanremo anche meglio di Amadeus.
Perché, ad esempio, il discorso sulla discriminazione non è stato fatto dal conduttore stesso? 

Ogni giorno una donna si sveglia e sa che per forza deve far sentire la propria voce e giustificare la sua presenza, ma poi accanto a lei c’è sempre un uomo che applaude sul momento, ma che appena può le prende la scena e continua i suoi atteggiamenti maschilisti o semplicemente superficiali.

Allora forse l’essere portavoce non sta portando a nulla, riprendiamoci i nostri spazi e non ringraziamo chi ha solo trasformato il termine “valletta” in “co-conduttrice” per fingere di adeguarsi ai tempi.

Title: The Blue Umbrella
Author: Ruskin Bond
Genre: novella/short story
Page count: 82 
Rating: 5/5

‘The umbrella was like a flower,
a great blue flower that had sprung 
up on the dry brown hillside.’

In between all the stress and gloomy atmosphere sometimes all you need is a book that can take you off all the negativity for a while. Ruskin Bond has always been one of my favourite authors and his short stories never fail to change my mood from ☹️ to 😊. 

This was story about a ‘pahadi’ girl named Binya who lived in a hill village of Garhwal with her mother and elder brother. The ten year old’s attraction towards a beautiful blue umbrella and owning it had caught everyone’s eyes in the village. From someone’s envy to someone’s excessive possessiveness she had to face everything in order to keep the umbrella safe and secured. Even when with time the umbrella was fading slowly, she still held on to it like she did on the first day.

Like every Ruskin Bond story this also circles around a bunch of emotions, heart touching acts and above all, the short span of this story can give you a lesson of kindness, happiness and a sense of positivity.

 So if you are in search of a feel good read then do grab this book without any delay. Much much much recommended. 

Also exams are coming so wish me luck 😬

Hope you all are having a great day. 💌

⭐️

Happy pub day ! This one is out today ! 😬

I don’t even really know what to classify this book as… A thriller? No… more like law / detective / drama? Either way, it just did not work me. 

Told in alternating POVs between Hannah - a law student, and Laura - Hannah’s mother (through journal entries). Mostly focusing on Hannah trying to play detective and solve her life’s mysteries… yawn. I feel like you really need to have interest in law theory in order to enjoy this book. 

Unfortunately I just did not enjoy this book whatsoever. I was bored to tears. I didn’t enjoy the writing style, the characters were such a mess and the whole book felt so disorganized. I didn’t find a single thing truly likeable in this story. I also skimmed the last 50 pages so that I could move on! 

Yikes ! 

Thanks to Harper Collins for providing me with an advanced copy in exchange for an honest review. I know a lot of people have been really enjoying this one so all opinions are my own :)

17897295197365318;"*Unpopular Opinion Alert*
Damnation Spring by Ash Davidson

This book takes place in a logging town on the California coast in 1977-1978. It’s told by multiple POV’s: Colleen, Rich and Chub.

Colleen is an unofficial midwife, Rich is a fourth generation logger and Chub is their young son. Colleen desperately wants more children, but she has had eight miscarriages in the past. Rich secretly spends their savings on nearby land in hopes for a better future, and Chub is a kindergartener.  Everything changes when Colleen’s old boyfriend, Daniel, comes to town. Daniel is a biologist and collects data on the pesticides sprayed around the community. Colleen challenges the logging company and starts questioning the sickness of the people in the town and the reasons for her multiple miscarriages. Colleen and Rich find themselves on opposite sides of the issue, but they must put their beliefs aside to protect their family. 

This was a story about family, community and environmental issues. I enjoyed the premise of the plot and all the characters, but it was way too slow for me. There was a lot of built up of the setting with it being a logging town, so much so I felt like nothing happened for the first 100 pages. Once it picked up it was interesting to see the views of the people and their thoughts on the pesticides. If you enjoy slow burn, atmospheric reads with family drama then this one is for you! 

⭐⭐⭐

A huge thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for a copy in exchange for my honest review.

College life is not that fun or interesting as they show in movies or web series. Since from 1st Year by passing every day it's start getting hard or stress getting increase. One side you can say college life is about having fun with friends and all but on the other hand every student is worried about what they are going to do after college how they gonna reach that 75% compulsory attendance or not get backlog. 
It started from college life is not about marks it about fun and learning experiences but as moved forward you will realise it's actually about numbers. I noticed someone college they were just doing  fests and celebrations whole year then in last they expect great marks too no they don't care about knowledge if you scoring high no matter how you are getting them. According to them If your attendance is above 75% n knowledge are zero,you are good student but if you short in attendance but getting higher marks then them still you are zero. Oh!!Yeah you can Work on you passion during college.  It's a lie too cause you not gonna get enough time to follow your wishes after having too much assignments you can't even think above assignment theories practical projects backlogs.

17921846771419832;"This post is going to address something controversial in the Little Free Library world…yes, you read that correctly. Controversy amongst library stewards does exist.

Earlier this week I came home to find my library completely emptied of all adult books (ok to be fair, they left a religious devotional and a how to paint book) 15+ books (many of them nice hardbacks/bestsellers/one full series) all gone in a few hours.

Here’s the controversy - there are some stewards (and others who don’t own a library but have really strong opinions on how to run one nonetheless) who say that we have no right to be upset about this. Maybe that person wanted to read all of those? Maybe they are hard up for money and need to take them and sell them? Maybe they don’t understand the concept of a LFL?

All of that could be true. But my stance is, feeling upset and frustrated by this happening is a valid feeling. I was so disappointed to come home and find it empty. I have a lot of books to stock it with, so it’s not the end of the world…it’s the principle. And other people being like, “Well, it does say FREE so why are you upset?” is rude. It just is.

I’m lucky this has only happened to me once. There are some stewards in the Facebook group who have had this happen over and over again. They put books in, it gets emptied. That is simply not sustainable. I’m extremely lucky to receive a good number of donations for mine (and I supplement with a trip to my local thrift store book sale as needed) but others shell out their own money to keep it stocked. So when I read posts about those stewards getting cleared out repeatedly and others telling them to stop whining that they can’t get upset? Nope. They’re allowed to be sad/mad/frustrated.

Thanks for letting me rant 💙 I’ve had my library for over 2 years and this is the first time it’s happened, so I’m lucky. I did restock, but I only put a few in to start just to make sure this isn’t a regular occurrence.";2022-08-13 13:05:51+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:51.089530+00:00;92;306;en

𝚄𝚗𝚙𝚘𝚙𝚞𝚕𝚊𝚛 𝚘𝚙𝚒𝚗𝚒𝚘𝚗 𝚊𝚕𝚎𝚛𝚝

I wanted to love this one but it just didn’t work for me. I relish in short chapters and this book had only 3! The formatting was the biggest struggle for me. I understand and appreciate the idea behind the 3 chapters and each being a day of the weekend, but it was all the jumping around from different perspective’s without clearly addressing who was speaking and when someone ended and a new one started just left me constantly in a state of confusion. 

I enjoyed the complex and unpredictable characters and I applaud that I wasn’t able to guess the ending, but with so much promise, unfortunately this was a let down for me. 

I have seen a lot enjoy this one so please make sure to check out and decide for yourself!

18001097443404858;"Review: Forty Rules Of Love by Elif Shafak

The Forty Rules of Love by Elif Shafak. Ah, the name itself stirs unnamed emotions, a book that has been doing the rounds I believe of major reading circles, being on their TBR’s and widely acclaimed for being a truly pursuable, exotic quest infused with Sufi mysticism and verse, a piece where faith and love are heartbreakingly explored. This is the second book in the #penguintransform Series, something which is garnering some of the most rave reviews in recent times. Well, this one was a life-changing, emotionally stirring read. The complete way in which Ella’s story unfolds before our eyes is resonation personified. I mean, you will relate to the picture painted of Ella and deep down get caught in the gripping scenarios her life entwines into. What actually was the life of this whole write up for me especially was the book within the book aka Sweet Blasphemy-the book that Ella ends up with, which brings about the changes for her. Not to forget the 2 parallel stories that run, one in the present contemporary world, the other in the 13th century. You shall relate them together in the end. Well, without revealing further I want to mention especially, how I loved Shams of Tabriz. Unpredictable, crazy, this one will carve a niche in your heart for keeps.

There is so much the book has to offer, I mean apart from the fact that it is set in the 13th century, there is so much going on- there is war, the religious diversity of opinions, Love, faith and even Sufism. I must commend the manner in which the author has put forward her perception brilliantly whilst bringing every single character to life.

A thought-provoking, moving piece of writing this one holds you in a way not many works of art can, amazing you with the emotional, enlightening ramifications it makes through its parallel track set up.

17956296452130629;"Let’s talk devotionals. ((Unpopular post alert 😬😊))

People often ask me what devotionals I recommend, and I always tell them the same thing: I don’t recommend them at all. (Please keep reading. 🙏🏻)

There may be fabulous godly devotionals out there, but here’s the thing: we all only have so many hours in a day, and if you’re reading a devotional, chances are really good that you’re not first reading the Bible, and sisters, reading His word must take precedence over reading anyone else’s.

And in reality, while there may be godly devotionals out there, the overwhelming majority—especially the ones aimed at women—are emotion-based and eisegetical, not exegetical, which is a big no-no if we are to understand and interpret the Bible properly.

So, how to read the Bible well this coming year? 

Let me encourage you to follow a set Bible reading plan for the year. Fortunately, there are plenty of excellent ones available online, plans for: 

reading through the Bible chronologically; 

reading specifically the New Testament chronologically; 

reading the OT and the NT in order (not chronologically but in placement order of the Bible at the same time—so a couple of chapters of Genesis and Matthew 1 on the same day, etc.) 

reading the entire Bible in a year with passages every single day or broken down five days a week so you have built-in catch-up time. (If you choose to do the latter, I highly recommend fivedaybiblereading.com. Super user-friendly and manageable. I’ve used that for years.)

Then if you want to dive even deeper in your Bible time, seek out some of the really good online Bible commentaries. Some trusted commentaries are by Matthew Henry, Charles Spurgeon, enduringword, John MacArthur, R.C. Sproul, A.W. Tozer, Leonard Ravenhill, to name a few.

17930089967557536;"BIOMECHANICS: Those who rest together…recover better 

We have talked a lot about movement and the factors that affect it, but what about the opposite, rest? 

Rest is an important part of our athlete's biology, for cells to repair, recover, and regenerate, the body must come to a “slow down” or “stop point” so that energy normally shifted to movement can be redirected to recovering the body. 

An object is said to be at rest if it does not change its position with respect to its surroundings with time…this can be sleeping or standing still in many cases. During this time we see many things but our focus is on:

Upregulation of healing factors 
-and-
Downregulation of cortisol, or stress hormones

Why do we care? Without rest, there is no recovery - without recovery, movement is affected - when movement is affected, BIOMECHANICS IS AFFECTED. 

So make sure your horses are allowed to rest! It is as important as movement 🖤🖤

Hola. Salgo un ratito del termo mundialista (aunque quiero seguir en este cumple por siempre 💙🤍💙) para comentar acerca de UNA CORONA DE HUESOS DORADOS, el 3er libro de la serie DE SANGRE Y CENIZAS de Jennifer L. Armentrout.

Como que de la historia mucho no les puedo contar porque todo es spoiler. Si puedo decirles que es fantasía con romance spicy.

A ver... amo a los personajes. La historia y el mundo están muy copados. Y tengo ganas de seguir leyendo esta serie y su spin off. Este 3er libro me pareció mejor que el 2do, pero el 1ro sigue siendo el mejor. Lejos.

En este 3ro me pasó que arranca muy bien. Pero después entra en una meseta laaaaarrrrga y pesada. Sé que son importantes los momentos de calma en donde te cuentan sobre la historia. Y suelem gustarme mucho esos capítulos. Pero la narrativa de este libro se me hizo pesada y por momento me aburría.

Los últimos capítulos están muy buenos y levanta. Pero de casi 800 páginas, le sacaría 400.

Lo leyeron? Qué les pareció?

Amé leerlo junto con pequeylibros paginasqueatrapan y nanubookreviews Sus comentarios y teorías me dan años de vida.

18295880722027805;"💀""Mortalista"" Max Czornyj💀

Jak zacząć pisać, nie mając za wiele do napisania? Czasami słowa same jawią się w głowie tworząc kompatybilny zlepek, układają się w sensowne zdania, wypływając wprost spod palców na klawiaturkę.
Czasami wyrzucam opinie z siebie w tempie wystrzałów z karabinu maszynowego, spisuję je pod wpływem chwili, impulsu. Wyrzucam z siebie wszystkie emocje towarzyszące mi podczas lektury, staram się przelać je na Was, niezależnie od tego na ile poprawnie są skomponowane, zawsze są szczere i moje. Czasami ogrom emocji potrafi przytłoczyć, rewelacyjny wydźwięk powieści okazuje się dla mnie zbyt ogromnym ciężarem i nie potrafię sprostać zadaniu. Czuję się nieadekwatną osobą, która mogłaby o danej książce napisać, zwyczajnie niekompetentną.

Tym razem nie potrafię ubrać w słowa tego co czuję po lekturze ""Mortalisty"" - dlaczego zapytacie? Dlatego, iż nie wzbudził on we mnie kompletnie żadnych emocji... no, oprócz finalnej radości, iż dobrnęłam do ostatniej minuty audiobooka i zakończyłam tę podróż z Honoriuszem i Allegrą (takie fancy imiona głównych bohaterów). Nie każda historia trafi do każdej osoby i tutaj mamy przykład, iż ja tym razem nie odnalazłam się w najnowszej prozie Pana Czornyja.

17957766560047944;"As I've gotten older, I look back on how I acted and presented myself when I was in my 20s and cringe.

I think that is what will happen to McCurdy as well.

This was entertaining enough but, despite the short chapters, it felt like it took me forever to get through.

It's unsettling and sad. I didn't find the humor other readers seemed to find and totally disagree with the blurb on the cover about it being ""an important cultural document.""

I think after, say, 20 more years, more healing and maturing, McCurdy will be able to write the book I was hoping for.

The Family Tree by Steph Mullin & Nicole Mabry
🌞🌞/5
 
Okay so let me start with the good. This book sounded very promising 👉🏻 swipe for description. I loved the alternating POVs and the book sucked me in from page 1 but I found myself quickly losing interest. Honestly, my favorite part was the chapters on the victims this self. Does this make me sadistic? Maybe 🤷🏼‍♀️. The main character Liz pissed me off because she just made the dumbest decisions and kept putting herself in unnecessary danger. I was not a fan of the ending at all. New character introduced in the epilogue? No thanks. I also didn’t like who the killer turned out to be, I mean come on. Not to mention there is one shady character that literally just falls off and we have no closure on the character. Alright that’s all I will say so I don’t give away spoilers. Even though this book wasn’t for me, it might be for you.

Thanks to sjump4203 for sticking out this buddy read with me🖤

Rating: 🌟🌟.5 / 5

✨ ⓇⒺⓋⒾⒺⓌ ✨

This will be an unpopular opinion, seeing there's a lot of 4/5 star rating for this book. However, I don't feel the same way.

This one has an interesting premise. I also like the vibes from the creepy dreams and the setting of New Orleans for this witchy book is a great combination.
I have to say the first few chapters and the last 20% of the book are fascinating and makes me feel curious. 

Despite all of that, there are some things that prevents me from fully enjoying this book. 
First of all, the pacing was very slow. It started to feel dragging and slightly repetitive in the middle of the story.

Second, the writing style. It feels slightly messy and I'm having difficulties trying to figure out when the character is in the dream or in reality. 
Not to mention, the multiple POV without knowing whose POV I'm reading until I read further into the chapter added my confusion. 

Lastly, some of the secondary characters also didn't really contribute to anything in the story even though they were mentioned quite a lot in the book, like Armand, Vincent and Nadia. 
Although, I really love Kat and Larz because they're a good friend for the main character. 
•
Overall, this book has a lot of potentials to be a really good one. I would have like it more if some things are more explained, especially about how the magic works.

I've read so many good reviews about this one, so I'm thinking this book just not my cup of tea😕

Idk it's just not great. :/ I tried giving it a listen around the time it came out and didn't like it. A couple months ago I gave it another chance cuz I didn't remember why I hated it and it was so bad I stopped listening to the song halfway through. The lyrics are terrible. I don't even really consider them lyrics honestly. I don't get what everyone sees in that song. Art is good at least. Oh, and I don't care that it's a vent song or that Ghost was young when they wrote it. I don't like it. To be fair though I like Ghost's newer music so there's that I guess

📖 𝗥 𝗘 𝗩 𝗜 𝗘 𝗪.

Happy Thursday, y’all! It’s almost the weekend, and I’m excited to be off work!
Here’s a book review that i’m way behind on 🙃

🔥 Twenty years ago, Tansy was drawn to Selene’s hard edges, her grit, and her knack for survival. Since then, the confused tangle of guilt about covering up a murder shattered their friendship, and even now, at thirty-eight, Tansy has never come to terms with what happened that night.
 
But now, Selene is back, demanding her old friend repay her. Selene’s daughter, Jupiter, attends the college where Tansy works as a guidance counselor. Selene is convinced that Jupiter’s boyfriend, Colton, is abusive, and wants Tansy to intervene. As she is drawn back into the intensity of Selene’s world, Tansy discovers the ugly truth about Colton. But Tansy suspects there’s far more to the story, and now she’ll finally have to confront Selene once and for all.

I read this one with my booksta bestie books_and_biceps9155 and I unfortunately thought this one was a bit overhyped, in my humble opinion.
I was super excited to read it, only to be super annoyed by the characters and some of the twists.
I went into it anticipating a thriller, which it really wasn’t, definitely more of a slow burn sort of mystery.
I did really enjoy the romance aspect and the alternating timelines of it, and I did really feel for Jupiter throughout the entire book, but it wasn’t enough to make this a five star read for me. Just wasn’t my fave. The end twist just felt super implausible. Will I read more Jody Gehrman? Absolutely. The book itself was super intriguing, I feel like in this case it was just too overhyped for me.

• some witty banter

I had high expectations for this one but it fell flat for me. The cover (which is so cute!) doesn't really match the story IMO. I didn't really connect with the characters or their relationship, and the middle was slow for me. I also didn't like the father storyline. There were parts that were good, but overall I just didn't love it. Despite this, I will still check out some of this author's other books and recommend giving this one a try if you're a romance reader!

17921224115293572;"👋🏻 Riemergo dal silenzio con un post che forse farà storcere il naso a qualcuno, ma... è proprio così che mi sento in questi giorni: SOPRAFFATTA!

👉🏻 Sopraffatta dalle mille ""Giornate"" che si susseguono, dopo 2 settimane vissute a singhiozzo tra DAD e DDI e gli scrutini che mi stanno con il fiato sul collo, le ultime valutazioni da assegnare, il carnevale che si avvicina, il secondo quadrimestre che incalza e i mille argomenti che mi sono resa conto di dover ancora trattare 🤯

👉🏻 Non voglio essere fraintesa: mi piacciono molto le ""Giornate Nazionali"" che offrono lo spunto per affrontare tematiche educative importanti e i periodi di festa che aiutano a rendere più frizzante la didattica. Ritengo fondamentale e necessario parlare a scuola di bullismo e cyberbullismo, aiutare ad apprezzare la diversità come ricchezza, mantenere vivo il ricordo e approfondire la conoscenza del periodo più buio della storia e riflettere sul presente, MA...

🛑 C'è un enorme MA che vorrei condividere con voi...non è il primo anno che in questo periodo penso:
➡️ ""Ha davvero senso?"" ⬅️
...chiedere OGNI ANNO ai bambini di indossare calzini spaiati e poi due giorni dopo (o prima...come nel nostro caso 😅) vestirsi di blu mentre intanto loro chiedono come ci vestiremo a carnevale prendendo tra le mani il foglio con l'ultima verifica (""un'altra?!"") che gli chiediamo di fare perché siamo stati a casa 2 settimane e non abbiamo potuto valutarli con più calma prima, HA DAVVERO SENSO?!

👉🏻 E la mia NON è una CRITICA alla Giornata dei Calzini Spaiati (che adoro!) o a quella contro il Bullismo (men che meno alla celebrazione del Giorno della Memoria), ma è la paura di banalizzare, di dover fare sempre tutto per forza e non riuscire ad arrivare davvero al cuore di questi temi...e dei bambini! 💙

👉🏻Sono argomenti importanti, che meritano di essere affrontati con percorsi lunghi e ben strutturati, riflettendoci su per un po', non (soltanto) il 7 febbraio perché lo dice il calendario o il 9 perché ce lo chiede l'istituto comprensivo...

18225739072080189;"We live in a society where the recommendation is not to get attached to things, experiences or people. That nothing is forever, that you’ll lose it, that if you get attached you’re inevitably going to end up feeling broken so don’t get vulnerable with it. A culture promoted by Instagram posts and tik tok videos that advise your best self is when you’re an independent boss babe who #staystoxic by keeping your guard up and not letting anyone threaten your ‘healing’.

But we heal broken bones to use them again. Why is heart any different?

I totally agree nothing is forever and anything can be taken from you unexpectedly in a matter of moments, but I also believe what we’re lacking as a society right now is the skills to move forward and the strategies to navigate through pain and push onwards. We need these teachings because we need to be able to feel fully. We’re missing out on the vulnerable human experience that allows us to feel deep love and immense connection and true bliss when we build such barriers. Science shows time and time again that humans are a species meant for community and social networks - it is detrimental to our mental health. 

Your brain is a filing cabinet. It holds all memories and information for the sole purpose of ‘keeping you safe’ and avoiding harm whether it be physical, emotional or otherwise. Tap out of this, feel it in the body, spirit or soul if you think you’ve got one, and use your mind for reprocessing. Inquire as to what files are in your brain, and store them correctly in the cabinet they truely belong, not where your brain originally stuffed it to ‘keep you safe’. 

I encourage you to teach yourself to heal, practice adaptation, and welcome all experiences fully so that alongside occasional pain of loss, you also get to appreciate true love in all its glory, whether it be from presence in a moment or connection with a person. 

Learn to keep your heart open, to adjust, and don’t let the human experience break your spirit.

17892175562503318;"I know this is a common phrase, but let me tell you why it has become an unpopular opinion:⁠
⁠
There’s this new belief that you can do everything by yourself by Googling it and that you don’t need to spend to build a great business. ⁠
⁠
And, maybe there’s someone out there that has done it.⁠
But with all due respect - I say B*LLSHIT!⁠
⁠
First of all, if you don’t invest in your business, then, are you actually taking it seriously? This is one of the smallest first commitments you can make in your business.⁠
Let me show you how in my new free masterclass {link in bio}.⁠
⁠
Second, not many people reach their goal income running on a scarcity mindset. If you’re always thinking you don’t have money so you won’t invest in good equipment, tools or resources for your business, you’re hurting you more than you can imagine. ⁠
⁠
Let’s look quickly at what happens when you DO actually invest in expert help:⁠
⁠
Take a recent graduate Ashley for example:⁠
👉🏻 She told me last month, “If I hadn’t hired you, I’d still be Googling ‘how to start a business’ rather than successfully running one.” Investing in her business helped her launch in under 90-days and now her business has incredible momentum behind it.⁠
⁠
Or take a current client Alicia for example:⁠
👉🏻 She didn’t have her current business concept when she started working with me. We brainstormed on a session and she revealed what she was really passionate about. Fast-forward a few weeks and she had booked 9 market’s. Fast forward a few weeks after that, she’s made over $6500 in two months!!! Which wouldn’t have happened if she was sitting around trying to figure it out.⁠
⁠
Or take current client Kristina for example:⁠
👉🏻 She randomly decided to launch a group program in her second month of the training and filled enrollment within a day.⁠
⁠
Taking the step to make the commitment to your business will produce results you can’t even imagine from where you’re currently at.⁠

17945569405588663;"Unpopular opinion time: 

I came across this “inspirational reel” and in this reel, it shows a bunch of riders being thrown from horses. Within this reel there is a quote:

“They get thrown, they get bitten, they get kicked and they get back on” 

I ask, WHY is this normalized? 

I am not judging those who shared this reel, but I’m asking you to look at that pride you felt from this reel from a different perspective. 

This sport is so dangerous because we allow it to be. Accidents do happen but a lot of riding incidents happen due to a horse being over threshold or put in an environment they weren’t ready for. 

Falling off is NOT inspirational. I’m sorry but it’s not. The myth “you need to fall off 7 times to be considered a good rider” is dangerous. As well, the quote: “You should get right back on the horse” mostly likely is in the human's best interest, not the horses.

If your horse is throwing you, kicking you or biting you:

something👏needs👏to👏be👏addressed👏

This should not be normalized. This should not be celebrated. If there is a pattern of this behaviour, it needs to be investigated by a professional. It’s also not something to be ashamed of, which I think was the whole point of this reel but I don’t think that injuries and falling off should be seen as a badge of honour.";2021-10-23 17:46:31+00:00;2023-03-27 14:38:55.900903+00:00;85;317;en

17901419033203490;"#TruthfulTuesday Just in case you think I love every book I read…. I don’t.
⠀
I had looked forward to reading Feral Creatures by Kira Jane Buxton since the second I finished her previous book, Hollow Kingdom. I absolutely loved Hollow Kingdom and was really looking forward to this next story where S.T. (Shit Turd) the crow, The One Who Keeps, raises the last human (MoFo) on earth.
⠀
My opinion seems to be contrary to the other reviews, all the ones I read were raves, yet I cannot rave about this book. I felt like it tried to hard. All the humor I found in the first book seemed forced in this book. The story of a world the humans had devastated was grim, which it realistic, but was so repetitive and a bit too gruesome at times.
⠀
ST, who I loved so much previously, irritated me with his single minded obsession with Dee, the young girl he has raised. Speaking of Dee, I ended up not caring a bit what happened to her.
⠀
I had to force myself to get through this book which is so opposite of the first one. I never put Hollow Kingdom down. I wondered if it was just my mood, the time, etc. that caused me to be disenchanted. However I read this over a month and my feelings never changed.
⠀
I will treasure Hollow Kingdom as a unique, favorite book. I will probably try to forget that Feral Creatures even exists.
⠀
Just my opinion. If you read it and loved it, I am really glad you did. I really wanted to love it myself.

Selen vs popular opinion 🤷🏻‍♀️

I had so much hard time with the story telling of this book. There was a lot of “telling” , here is an example:

“Henry goes out to his orchard and sits. He wears no jacket or hat or gloves. His eyes are rimmed with grey.”

It just felt like someone kept reading things to me and I couldn’t connect with the characters, story besides feeling so depressed. I thought the whole point of 3rd POV telling was to be able to deliver emotions of multiple characters, I just couldn’t feel the emotions, they all felt like robots 😕

I’ll never forgive Renshu / Henry for not manning up and taking care of his loved ones. He just sucked my energy throughout the entire book with this choices 🤦🏻‍♀️

17955772229254221;"Do you feel like you are posting so many stories but aren't getting the response you thought you would? 😔⠀
⠀
Here are a few reasons why your stories may be flopping 👇⠀
⠀
👉 You're not showing your face⠀
Whilst every story doesn't need to be of you, people on social media tend to respond more positively to stories (and posts) of people behind the brand.⠀
⠀
👉 You're posting too many at once⠀
It might seem tempting & convenient to post all your stories for the day in one hit to get it over & done with, but people have a very short attention span on social media. They want to take in what your story has to say, and move onto the next. If they are having to tap through 20 stories in one sitting, it's going to make them bored and disinterested. ⠀
⠀
👉 Your stories are not engaging with your followers⠀
Are you using quizzes or polls in your story? Are you asking for your followers input? People want to connect with brands, and if you aren't pushing out content that does that, they will move on to someone who does.⠀
⠀
👉 You're talking without captions⠀
Your stories need to be accessible, so ensure when you are creating stories where you are speaking in them, that you have captions available. Also, a lot of people have their phones on silent and their volume down (like me!) so captions provide a nice visual aid for those of us who don't like our phones making sounds 😝⠀

I absolutely loved Amelia Unabridged last year. I’m fact, it was one of my top books of the year, so I had very high expectations for Full Flight. Wellll…unfortunately, it didn’t live up to those expectations for me.

The writing was beautiful and lyrical, but my biggest issue is that the first 2/3 was just blah for me. Then something tragic happens, and the last 1/3 was completely heartbreaking. And not in a good way. I felt like things were rushed and pieced together, too.

17954282039252473;"This was classic millennial fodder with all the clichéed cultural references to try and hook us in. I can’t talk, of course, for I love writing trash and I haven’t sold 600,000 copies. 

Grace is simultaneously dead inside, impervious to social norms such as friendships, and yet demonstrates through the book the greatest emotional action of them all: murder for love. This contradiction is what felt wrong for me.  I wish I could have believed in Grace as a character a little more and I wish the writing style hadn’t been so repetitive. For example: I wish she hadn’t used ‘fervently’ quite so much (five times once I started counting and getting irritated) . 

But it’s a sad tale and certainly not a bad one. Grace is someone who exhibits traits of an emotionally unstable personality disorder. She has suffered an immense trauma at a young age (the death of a parent and the complete rejection from
another). She believes in a fairytale ending once ‘that one last thing is sorted’. Kill everyone = live happily ever after. And for that, I was on her side. 

I felt frustrated by the end. Maybe you’re supposed to but it felt rushed and only slightly more sophisticated than ‘and then I woke up’. 

Sorry Bella, I didn’t love it. But who cares what I think, everyone else seems to love it and you can roll around in your piles of cash basking in the knowledge that over half a million people have read your book. That’s at least three million ferventlys.

I am going to do a bit of Backman bashing here so if you're a fan, run like the wind my friend!

I loved A man called Ove and knowing this the lovely Roseline rose.reads_ gifted me this book. Love you for that! ❤

Fans of this one say that it is whimsical and humorous. I agree, but there's a fine line to humor. Take it too far and it gives a deja vu feeling( and that's just me being nice, avoiding the dreaded clichè word). 

Mental health as a theme is close enough to my heart that any book that tackles it is an automatic winner but Backman didn't make me empathize with any of the people.

On the contrary, I was annoyed. 

Not with the characters, with the way it was written. Jumping back and forth, conversational style. Like a train that switches back a few meters every ten minutes. 

That's all. 

It had the potential to be so much more. I loved the premise. I loved the plot twists and the ending. 

But it was a let down. 

Well. You win some, you lose some!

P.s Look how the pretty bougainvillea matches the book cover. Half a point for being aesthetic.

Blood Orange by Harriet Tyce

Thanks again pandas_reading_favourites for gifting me this (ages ago)

🔍 PLOT: Alison has it all - doting husband, adorable daughter, and a career on the rise - she's been given her first murder case to defend. But all is never as it seems...

Just one more night. Then I'll end it.

Alison drinks too much, neglects her family, and is having an affair with a colleague whose taste for pushing boundaries may be more than she can handle.

I did it. I killed him. I should be locked up.

Alison's client doesn't deny that she stabbed her husband - she wants to plead guilty. And yet something about her story is deeply amiss.

I'm watching you. I know what you're doing.

But someone knows Alison's secrets and wants to make her pay. They won't stop until she's lost everything...

🎭 GENRE: Fiction

🤓 THOUGHTS: I'm really surprised by the glowing reviews this book has as I actually hated it.

I have so many issues with it - the main character, Alison, is horrible but also her character makes no sense. She's supposed to be a successful barrister, yet she drinks to excess, is a doormat to the men in her life, and never seems to actually do any work. Her husband treats her awfully, yet the man she has an affair with treats her even worse! Why would you even go there?

Speaking of the men in the book, they are all deviants of some sort - I don't know if the author has a problem with men, but I really got that feeling from the book. If it was meant to redeem Alison for her behaviour, then it didn't for me.

I struggled with the fact that a mother would actually leave her daughter without a fight (hello successful barrister?), where that twisted ending came from and how it just happened to nicely tie everything up.

I was expecting a thriller, but the majority of this was drama: Alison has an affair, feels guilty, tries to stop for her ""marriage"", drinks, then repeats over and over. The murder case she was handed was such a tiny part of the story - and that's the part I was most looking forward to. So, as you can tell, this one definitely wasn't for me.

¡Hola! Hoy os traigo este post sobre la saga Sombra y hueso. 

Fue una de mis primeras lecturas del año pasado y mi primer unpopular opinion. He de decir que la lectura fue mejorando poco a poco, pero en general me costó leerla, ya que no me conseguía atrapar del todo.😞

Por otro lado, decir que el libro que le sigue, Seis de cuervos, no tiene nada que ver. Fue una de mis mejores lecturas del año pasado. Y amo muchísimo a los personajes.😍 Mis favoritos son Nina y Kaz. Con ganas de ponerme pronto con Reino de ladrones. 😃

¿Cuál es vuestro unpopular opinion?

𝗦𝗺𝘂𝘁 𝗥𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: what smut ?… I’m ok with that - just don’t go looking for it 
𝗚𝗲𝗻𝗿𝗲: romance with a bit of travel ⁣
⁣
Needless to say - this book didn’t work for me. Told in the present and in flashbacks to previous trips ( which all seem to be about Poppy not having money, drinking too much, and thinking she really really loves Alex but not in that way at least not 95% of the time 🤦🏼‍♀️) , it’s a love story between two friends ….⁣
⁣
I had such high expectations for this book that I realize some of my disappointment comes from that - but really I don’t get all the hype 🤷‍♀️ I would say it’s probable a 2.5-3 ⭐️ read for me ⁣

📖: Razorblade Tears
✍️: S.A. Cosby

➡️ Read this if...you like explosive action movies that have a revenge mission.

📚Summary: A black father and a white father join forces when their gay sons are murdered. Driven largely by their guilt for how they handled their sons’ sexuality, the men set out to hunt down those responsible for their sons’ deaths. Carnage and mayhem ensue.

🤔💭: I feel like I’m the last person on Bookstagram to have read this one. It got so much attention last year and I wasn’t sure if it would live up to the hype for me. I did like the book overall. It was full of action and kept me turning the pages. I appreciated how the author handled heavy topics like LGBTQIA+ rights, interracial relationships, and racism. However, I didn’t love the idea that I was supposed to be rooting for these men who treated their sons terribly while they were alive as they went around killing a ton of people all in the name of vengeance. Unpopular opinion, I know!

My rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️//5

🗣: What’s a popular book you feel like everyone’s read but you?

My Thoughts: I’ll start by saying that this is one of my absolute favorite covers of 2022, but I wish the insides were are good as the outside for me. This was my first book by this author and I can tell she is a great story teller, but I’m not sure I fully got this one. There was a lot going on in this book and some jumping timelines and things for easily muddled for me. I enjoy a good dysfunctional family story, but this one was a stretch. ⁣
⁣
There are a lot of potential triggers as well, including: child abuse, animal abuse, animal testing, infidelity, and plenty more. I work in a laboratory environment that requires animal testing so I feel like what went on in this book really struck a nerve and was really unethical (although it was intentional for the story). And then there was also a story within a story that never made any sense to me. ⁣
⁣
I really wanted to like this one. There were parts I enjoyed but overall I just felt confused. ⁣
⁣
Read this if you are a fan of: Stephen King, horror, science experiments gone wrong⁣

17917288151182905;"Other than the popular VOCALOID3's like Tianyi, Lily, Oliver, Gakupo, Flower, and Yukari; I feel as if there aren't many great or popular original songs featuring VOCALOID3's like Mayu, Hio, or even Kokone and Merli. I know a lot of people don't necessarily care for VOCALOID3 anymore because of course, we have so many new engines out there that are way better than VOCALOID3. I mean come on, VOCALOID3 was released in 2011 so of course usages were way different back then. But that's not the issue. the issue is trying to find good usage of VOCALOID3's NOW. You'd expect people to own these VOCALOID's, they definitely had their time of popularity. But why is it that I simply can't find anything. I tried Niconico, Youtube, SoundCloud, BiliBili, etc,. I can only find two original Mayu songs and one Merli and Aoki cover. Maybe I just suck at looking I don't know. Characters like Mayu and Hio were definitely popular and still are I'm sure. But I feel they are more popular as characters, not as a vocalsynth. I don't know it just makes me a little sad realizing that the only thing people talk about is their characters and not their voices. For example whenever Hio is brought up the only conversation people would have is about his provider, and when Mayu is brought up it's only about her Yandere attribute. People only ever talk about how much of a fail Kokone was. It could be the discussions I'm seeing on various social media so I won't say that everyone says these things or feels this way. This opinion is purely from my failure of finding good original VOCALOID3 songs and some discussions I've seen

18226652821094081;"Book Review

THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE OF SAM HELL by Robert Dugoni

From GoodReads: Sam Hill always saw the world through different eyes. Born with red pupils, he was called “Devil Boy” or Sam “Hell” by his classmates; “God’s will” is what his mother called his ocular albinism. Her words were of little comfort, but Sam persevered, buoyed by his mother’s devout faith, his father’s practical wisdom, and his two other misfit friends.

Unpopular Opinion Warning! According to other reviews, I’m in the minority in thinking this book was less than extraordinary. It didn’t help that I expected A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY or BOY’S LIFE. The pacing was fine, the character development was satisfactory, and the story was mostly interesting, but it didn’t wow me. 

While I appreciated the themes of faith and perseverance, the book didn’t live up to its hype. It was just ordinary. I didn’t FEEL the story; I only heard it.

The author narrated the audiobook. Would a different performer have increased my enjoyment?

What about you? Have you read SAM HELL? What did you think?

But people disliked it so much, that the company held a design contest, and now we have the newer designs which, although they’re nice, frankly don’t fit Bruno and Clara. It was also the same with releases like the Zola Project. We as a community need to be more open to different designs and art styles with certain vocal synth releases.

17914625963113177;"An induction might be convenient for your obstetrician or midwife, but it’s not convenient, or kind to your baby.

If we’re being really real about the induction epidemic that’s happening in industrial maternity care, all the justifications - big baby, small baby, health conditions, high risk, blah blah blah - these are lies and excuses to fit you into a convenient schedule and timing.

Induction means you’re more likely to end up with an epidural. The effect of this is that your birthing hormones will be overridden by the synto and the epidural drugs will stop or slow down production of the same hormones - that also benefit your baby and help them in the birth process - this means your baby is subjected to forced non-stop artificial contractions with non of the benefits of your natural innate birthing hormones, or a vastly reduced amount of them.

Why is such a violent and forced process be pushed onto women as necessary and beneficial? Or for babies who are already deemed “at risk”. The illusion and lie that this is for safety starts to fall apart when you think critically. 

If a baby’s health was truly in peril, why would you subject a baby to the stressors of induction. If there’s a genuine emergency and that baby needs saving from the pregnancy and the stress of (unnatural induced) birth then a c-section should be automatic. I’m not promoting c-sections by acknowledging this either, I’m questioning the entire racket of induction as a safe pathway.

🐢 Dragi moj, želio sam da poslednji prikaz u godini bude neka divna knjiga ali to jednostavno, ovog puta, nije slučaj! 

🐘 Jako su mi se dopale korice ove knjige i opisi koje sam našao po netu.  Želio sam da ovo bude serijal kome ću se vraćati i redovno ga čitati. Međutim, mislim da je ovo sve sto ću pročitati od Pračeta. 🤨

🐘 Knjiga je (srećom) jako kratka iako mi se činilo da je čitam mjesec dana. Nije mi se dopao isprekidani stil pisanja koji ne pruža nikakav uvid u karaktere likova, sem možda u slučaju glavnog lika. 

🐘 Očekivao sam da budem oduševljen kritikom društva, humorom, maštovitošću, slikovitošću, ovog djela o kojima sam čitao po #bookstagram -u,  ali to se uglavnom nije desilo. 

🐘 Ovo je jedna suvoparna knjiga prilikom čijeg čitanja nisam doživio nikakvo zadovoljstvo. 
Čitalačkom iskustvu nije pomogla ni jako loša štampa, slova i riječi koje nedostaju, bar u mom primjerku! 

✖️ Imate moju preporuku da zaobiđete ovu knjigu

Inhalt: Eiskunstläuferin Paisley flieht vor ihrer traumatischen Vergangenheit nach Aspen, wo sie neben neuen Freunden auch die Liebe findet. Doch Snowboard-Star Knox ist ebenfalls gebrochen und macht ihr den Neuanfang alles andere als leicht.
.
Meine Meinung: Was mit einem schönen Setting & einer interessanten Grundidee begann, wurde für mich leider eine konstruierte, klischeebehaftete und NICHT nachvollziehbare Geschichte.
.
Drei Faktoren empfand ich als besonders störend: 1. Fast alles in diesem Plot geschieht aus Zufall (in jeder Szene taucht Knox dort auf, wo Paisley ist und umgekehrt usw. Es gab keinerlei Nebenhandlung.).
2. Das vermittelte Frauenbild bezüglich der Statistinnen und Nebenfiguren war unterirdisch. Es wurde extrem gegen Frauen, die sich gerne schminken, geschossen und jedes weibliche Wesen hat sich irre aufgeführt, sobald Knox auftauchte (weil ALLE ihm so dringend an die Wäsche wollten …) 🙄
3. Diversität schlecht umgesetzt. Es gibt nur eine deutlich als PoC gekennzeichnete Figur und die lebt im Reservat, verkauft Armbänder und hat einen Namen, über dessen wortreiche Bedeutung sich mehrmals im Buch von Paisley und Co. lustig gemacht wird. Was ist daran bitte witzig??? 
Eine Freundin von Paisley wird außerdem damit beschrieben, dass sie vom Aussehen her dem Disney-Charakter Vaiana ähneln solle. Ist sie damit eine PoC? I don‘t know.  Es wurde aus der Geschichte heraus nicht deutlich. Generell empfand ich die meisten Figuren als flach.
Das einzige homosexuelle Paar war überdies ein wandelndes Klischee und charakterlich unausgearbeitet, so als wäre ihre Queerness allein ein  Charakterzug.
.
Abschließend muss ich leider sagen, dass das Buch weder vom Inhalt noch vom Schreibstil her mein Fall war. Die intimen Szenen warteten mit vielen (für mich unangenehmen) Stilmitteln auf (endlose Wiederholungen von Satzfragmenten) und das Ende löste sich wieder per Zufall und viel zu simpel …

17916337145268953;"💥 Book Review 💥

Happy Monday friends! I hope everyone has a wonderful week.

This one is an unpopular opinion, but it's okay, not everyone is going to love the same book.

The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller ⭐⭐⭐

Maybe it was the mental state that I was in, but I did not love this book the way that I was going to. The book is so loved around the booksta community, but I didn't feel the same love that so many people did. The pacing was so weird. It started off slow, but I really loved the parts where they were in the caves, getting to know each other, and when they were with Chiron. When they got to Troy, it was a rollercoaster of pacing, some parts were great, and other parts were dreadfully slow. The interactions between Patroclus and Achilles were amazing, and I loved their interactions. You could definitely feel the love between the two, even when Achilles was distant with Patroclus during the war. The book was written beautifully, and the parts I enjoyed, I really liked and I think that's why I rated the book three stars.

Just because I am rating this book three stars, and reviewing it the way I am, does not mean anything! This is just my opinion. I really hope you love this book more than I did when you read it yourself!

🌠If so, what are your thoughts?

“The thing about grace is that you don’t deserve it. You can’t earn it. You can only accept it. Or not.”

Unpopular Opinion here, but this book was not my favorite. To be completely honest I was a tad bored through most of it. Before you go hitting that unfollow button since this is a very unpopular opinion let me explain why…
•
This book is listed as a thriller. IT IS NOT A THRILLER. There is absolutely nothing thrilling about this book. This book is more of a survival and the lengths a father would go to in order to protect his daughter. Do not get me wrong, this book was written so beautifully that of course I felt invested in it, but I just wanted more, I needed more.
•
There was a bit of a mystery to this one. As things begin to unravel, I began to I enjoy the characters, but there were times that I questioned the sincerity of the main character. This story is without a doubt unique, but while I did enjoy it; it wasn’t my favorite.
•
I’m also torn on the ending, at one part for me I was heartbroken, at the other, I was angry and had some questions…
• Overall, this one was just okay for me, I could take it or leave it. There are reviews all over raving about this one, so don’t let my unpopular opinion deter you from reading this short, very unique and beautifully written story.
•
This was our February pick for better.read.than.dead.bookclub and I’m super excited to discuss with everyone later this month!

QOTD: What’s for dinner? I need to know because I need ideas for tonight 🤣

📕The Collective 
Alison Gaylin

The Collective needs no introduction, it’s all over the place. It’s probably one of the more popular books on my feed lately. 

I wasn’t impressed, actually I found it predictable and and unoriginal.  It absolutely did not live up to its hype. I was bored. 

I’m not sure why people are going crazy over it. Maybe it’s because I have been a long time reader of thrillers and twisted detective stories, and this premise is used a ton. 

Strangers working together to enact their own justice and revenge against those that have wronged them.  It’s been done time and time again.  Throw in white power, privilege, and money, and you have a cliche story that lacks anything unique to make it stand out. 

I think if it wasn’t a BOTM pick it wouldn’t have gained as much momentum or popularity. 

The Collective had potential but fell short. Would I recommend it, probably not because there are so many better thrillers out there.

17910910442218698;"A HUGE lesson from 2021…

𝙋𝙚𝙤𝙥𝙡𝙚 𝙬𝙞𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙣𝙡𝙮 𝙗𝙚 𝙖𝙗𝙡𝙚 𝙩𝙤 𝙞𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙥𝙧𝙚𝙩 𝙬𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙮 𝙨𝙚𝙚 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙝𝙚𝙖𝙧 𝙛𝙧𝙤𝙢 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙡𝙚𝙣𝙨 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 𝙬𝙝𝙞𝙘𝙝 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙮’𝙫𝙚 𝙗𝙚𝙚𝙣 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙙𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙚𝙙.

Let’s dive into what is meant here...

Imagine a group of people walked into a comedy show.  They all spend exactly 2 hours listening to 5 different comedians and then once the show is over, they go home and share how their night was.

𝙎𝙤𝙢𝙚 𝙬𝙞𝙡𝙡 𝙨𝙖𝙮:

“It was awesome”
“I died laughing, it was like an ab workout”
“Some of them where funny and others not so much”
“I was super offended the entire time”
“I couldn’t believe how many people laughed at the dumbest jokes I’ve ever heard”
“You HAVE to go see that show, I loved it”
“Don’t go see that show, waste of money”
“I will never go back to that place”
“The opening acts where better than the main show”

We can all agree that some people will love it, some will hate it and there will be many layers in between.

Now remember, all of the people saw the exact same show.  And they all left with their “own opinion”. Their opinion is entirely made up of thoughts and beliefs from their own lives. What they deem as ok, and what they deem as not okay. 

So is anyone one of these opinions wrong? 

No…  They are all speaking their own truth based on how they see the world. 

So the next time you judge how someone else feels remember…

Yes your opinion is true AND so is theirs.  There is no right or wrong, only the lens with which you’ve been conditioned to view it with that makes you feel that way.

Do you agree?

17936932015843747;"💍💔🥀 Book Review🥀💔💍

📖: The Golden Couple
✍️: Greer Hendricks & Sarah Pekkanen

➡️Read this if…you have ever wondered if therapy could change your life.

📚Summary: This has been all over IG so I’ll be brief. Avery is a therapist who is known for using questionable, albeit highly successful, techniques with her patients, such as spying on them outside of their sessions. Marissa and Mathew Bishop are a seemingly “golden” couple trying to overcome one night of extramarital indiscretion. Avery takes the couple on as clients and gets a whole lot more than she bargained for.

🤔💭: I was on the fence about ordering this from BOTM, but all the good reviews on booksta swayed me. I bounced back and forth between my physical copy and the audiobook. I will say that this was better than I expected, but I still felt underwhelmed by the whole story. I think this one is way overhyped (unpopular opinion, I know!) and while it was enjoyable overall, there’s nothing about it that really made it stand out for me against all the usual thrillers I read. I still can’t figure out why it’s so popular. 🤷‍♀️

My rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️💫//5 

A big thanks to netgalley, the authors, and macmillan.audio for an ALC in exchange for my honest review!

 🗣 What’s a book you’ve read recently that you felt was overhyped?

Just like I never fully switch off from being a mom; even during my ‘personal time’, at some point I’m thinking about my kids. 

Any parent (new parents especially) can confirm that date night often includes scrolling through photos of your kids, talking about the funny things they did and said.

This is normal. I’d never say to Dan we shouldn’t talk about the kids because this is ‘our’ time.

𝐈𝐭 𝐬𝐞𝐞𝐦𝐬 𝐨𝐝𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐬 𝐝𝐨𝐧’𝐭 𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐬𝐭 𝐢𝐧 𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐨 𝐛𝐞 𝐟𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭. 

Where did we get that from?

If work is so disruptive that it’s ‘off limits’ on date night, at the dinner table or anywhere else for that matter, I’d be questioning whether I’m in the right line of work.

So no, I don’t switch off from my work, my work fits around my life. I’ve learned to have firm boundaries, communicate often with Dan and the kids so we’re on the same page, and to bring them into the vision. We’re working as a team to make it happen and we all play a role.

My work life balance is fluid, in that it’s not balanced at all. There are times when I prioritise my family and others, my business and I’m good with that. I don’t have any hard and fast rules about how it’s supposed to look (and that satisfies my feminine energy).

Plus, I’ve learned that when you truly love what you do, it often doesn’t feel like work.

17984522455685068;"📖 Book Review 📖 

Michaela and Eve are both first year students at a prestigious uni in Sydney. In the uncertain hum of the first few weeks, they befriend each other, however I’d say their relationship is more frenemy than bff right off the bat. It’s propelled forward by proximity vs actual kinship. Moving within the same circles, they soon get close, until an event drives a wedge between them. 

This is going to be an unpopular opinion, I just couldn’t really like this book. Every character was annoying to me, but I think that was the point. 

I found the relationships between the characters a little off. It seemed that everyone was distant, there wasn’t a closeness that’s usually present in these sorts of friendship groups, but perhaps this was the point, given they didn’t know each other well? It just resulted in me not caring about any of the characters. I enjoyed the scenes with Michaela and Balth, that was the only friendship that seemed genuine and ‘flowed’ well. 

The smattering of philosophy and smart/ annoying snark that could only come from 18 year old kids who think they know everything made it a hard read for me. The writing was good, but I kept waiting for something to happen with a major plot point, and it just didn’t get there for me. 

This seems to be a firm booksta favourite, so I’ll concede I’m in the minority with this one! I honestly felt like I was reading a different book to everyone else, although admittedly this has happened a few times when I pick up a book after the initial hype.

What’s a popular book you picked up and felt completely different about?

18187340092089518;"❄️ RESEÑA ❄️

Por fin ha llegado a España uno de los libros más esperados por los y las fans de la fantasía juvenil, se trata de El reino de los malditos, inicio de trilogía escrita por Kerri Maniscalco y publicada por el sello Puck. 

Las expectativas estaban muy altas, por las nubes, y ese ha sido el principal problema del porqué este libro me ha decepcionado tanto. No es un mal libro, pero yo esperaba muchísimo de él y al final... pues ha sido más de lo mismo. La típica historia de fantasía juvenil, con los mismos personajes estereotipados de siempre. ¿Entretiene? Si, y eso es importante. Pero no deja de ser decepcionante que siempre se recurra a lo mismo una y otra vez: protagonista que es forzada a ser ""fuerte"" y un romance que sale de la nada en apenas unos capítulos.

La trama es bastante pasable pero tampoco es nada del otro mundo. Tiene lo justo para entretener, igual que la ambientación, en una Italia del siglo XIX llena de comida y olores riquísimos por todas partes. Una Palermo oscura y siniestra llena de brujas y otro tipo de criaturas con las que no te gustaría toparte. Eso ha sido lo que más me ha gustado.

Pero los personajes... Emilia no me ha gustado nada. Me ha parecido una chica sosa y egoísta. No he podido empatizar con ella. Por otro lado, Wrath ha estado un poco mejor pero no ha tenido gran relevancia y no sé muy bien cuales son sus intenciones. La relación de amor, como he dicho antes, forzada. No es una relación de amor como tal, solo se están ""acercando"" el uno al otro por así decirlo, pero los pensamientos de Emilia sobre Wrath... pues bueno. Los típicos. Que de un momento a otro pasen del odio a preocuparse ""amorosamente""... no me gusta. 

💫 Tenéis la reseña completa en el blog, babelio y Goodreads (link en mi bio)

Le he dado una nota de 4'5/10

I don’t always share books I don’t love, but I’m in a mood, and read a few meh books in a row, so content is lacking. So here we go:

This was definitely not what I was expecting. It is not a cute. It is not a light Christmas read. It is not funny. It not a romcom like I would have expected. I think parts of it dragged on and the ending made me feel some emotions, but I’m not sure it justified the beginning 75%. Honestly, I was annoyed at the ending and felt duped and like it wasn’t worth the read.

Let's stop assuming skinny = healthy

Let's stop assuming someone's health solely based on their body size

Let's stop asking unqualified people for nutrition advice. Just because you like the way someone looks doesn't mean they are qualified to tell you how YOU should eat.

Let's not normalize guilt and anxiety around food

Let's not normalize weighing every single food you eat

LET'S infact normalise going out for brunch and choosing the option you want and enjoying it without guilt or compensation. 

LET'S normalise joyful movement, and wanting to exercise to feel strong, functional and for stress relief. Not due to self hate and guilt.

LET'S normalise eating balanced with no extremes

LET'S normalise body acceptance 

LET'S normalise a healthy mindset towards food

.
Because I have personally struggled with eating disorders and know the hell it is to struggle, it frustrates me that there are so many harmful and toxic messages being sent out. That certain behaviours are being normalised and promoted for ""health"". But in reality if the person really were to reflect upon their behaviours I'm sure they would come to the conclusion that weighing a banana or their almonds has absolutely nothing to do with health, and more to do with body control. [Just an example]
.
I call out diet culture and toxic messages because I know first hand the damage it does, both mentally and physically.

✨Unpopular Opinion✨

I’m constantly asked why I give every book a good rating. Even though it seems like I do, don’t post or even write reviews on books that I didn’t like on Bookstagram. If I didn’t like it, I won’t promote it. So I thought i would change it up and share a book that I didn’t enjoy. 

🇫🇷The Paris Apartment by Lucy Foley 

Imagine there is a certain food that everyone likes but no matter how hard you try to like it, it’s just not something you enjoy. Let’s say the food you dislike is asparagus, so you wouldn’t go to a restaurant and order asparagus. 
Lucy Foley is my asparagus. 
I have seen nothing but stellar reviews on The Paris Apartment and even though I’ve tried to read and ended up dnf’ing both of her prior works, I thought I may enjoy her newest one. 
I was wrong. 

Looking for a fresh start, Jess leaves London to stay with her brother Ben in Paris. When Jess arrives at Ben’s apartment, he is nowhere to be found. The longer he is gone the more desperate to find him Jess becomes. Jess starts to investigate Ben’s disappearance and becomes suspicious of his eclectic neighbors in his apartment building. 

I don’t mind a slow burn, literary, character driven plotless story but The Paris Apartment was so slow that it was painful. Nothing whatsoever happens at all in the first 3/4 of the book. I kept pushing myself to finish the book, just to see if I was missing something that everyone else sees. 

Just when you think something exciting is going to happen it doesn’t. I feel like the author could have taken this book so many different directions to provide an entertaining story.

Listen friends, 
there is nothing wrong with liking Lucy Foley or asparagus. The writing isn’t terrible but it’s just not for me. We all like and enjoy different things. I’m not bashing this book or anyone that enjoyed it. I truly wished that I could have also enjoyed it. With the author’s massive success on The Guest List there is no doubt in my mind that this will be one of the most popular books of the year and I’m sure many readers will love it. I just wish I was one of those readers.";2022-03-19 13:38:27+00:00;2023-03-27 14:39:02.564506+00:00;140;1024;en

Name a book everyone else loved that left you feeling meh 😑 
✨
I went into the Flatshare with high hopes. Maybe that was my problem. My expectations were too high. I read the synopsis and said: This is something I will love! I was mistaken. I know I am in the minority with my opinions on this novel, but it just left me lacking. I could not connect at all with Tiffy. I was bored stiff while reading it, especially Leon’s chapters. The writing style for him felt like I was reading his journal or maybe someone writing school notes. Don't even get me started on how tiny the print was! 

The way Tiffy and Leon communicated was obviously the book's highlight and a unique concept. I found myself skipping through chapters just to read their post-it notes. 

The romance and character development for me were lacking. I was more interested in Richie than in either of the main characters. Maybe it was me, but I struggled a lot to picture the characters and see them standing before me. Usually, I can do so without any problems but not this time. I made it about 45% through the book, hoping I would change my mind because I wanted to love this book but ultimately 
this was a DNF.

Book 155 of 2021
Genre: contemporary romance(I think?)
Length: 582 pages (DNF’d at page 252)

I have SO MANY thoughts about this book that I’d never be able to fit in an IG caption, and furthermore, I’ve been posting my reactions in my stories.  I did write a really long rant on my blog, link in bio and on my story (because I finally have the link sticker!), but for the sake of brevity here, I will share only the hottest of my hot takes about After.

I’m genuinely surprised that Harry Styles has never spoken out about this series because he must he horrified that it is based on him.  I was pretty heavily involved in online fandom once upon a time, and even wrote some fanfiction myself, but writing fanfic about real people never sat right with me and this is why. 

I remember when this book came out when I was in high school, and how the teen media outlets I followed hyped it up.  NOT a good look, Seventeen and Teen Vogue.  The idea of promoting this book, and a fanfic writer who had no plans to be an author (which I remember Anna Todd admitting to in an interview), instead of,say, a legitimate, talented young up-and-coming author to teenage girls makes me so mad now that I think about it. 

I realize fanfiction’s place in the broader culture, and how it is a starting point for many up-and-coming authors, but they have usually graduated to writing original content by the time they get published.  Had After been the catalyst for Anna Todd to study writing and begin writing her own stories (with After never existing outside of Wattpad), she could be a decent romance author right now.  But that is not the case.  Also, back to my qualms about teen media outlets promoting the book: who thought it was okay to send teenage girls the message that they could write poorly written fanfiction that leans into harmful tropes, melodrama, and (icing on the cake) paints a famous person in a terrible light and become a bestselling author instead of achieving that through legitimate avenues?

I promised my sister that I’d give this -15 stars, so.

Originally I was going to give it a pretty low rating. I’m not a fan of the insta-love trope, and this book leaned into that way more than I expected. Also the relationship between the two main characters made me a little uncomfortable more than once and I skipped through a few parts (the insta-love really did not help here).

I will say, however, that the last hundred or so pages partially redeemed the book for me. The plot twist was so unexpected, and I was sucked in once I got to the sixth November (iykyk). I won’t spoil the book, so I will just say that I found the ending really gripping and thought-provoking.

Overall, I am still trying to decide how I feel about this book. I do think, though, that Colleen Hoover books just might not be my thing :)

Oe they miss the part were Miku is running towards an edge and the boy STOPS her. Or the ending itself! People say the ending is Miku ""giving in"" to her depression and dying, when is obvious that the ending is supposed to be hopeful! The ""the boy is her depression"" interpetation feels so forced, like its just trying to be like ""oh, you thought the end was happy, but its actually sad and grim, fooled ya!"" but if you pay actual attention to the video, it doesn't make sense, there's nothing hinting to that. I think i wouldn't hate this interpretation so much if some people didn't treat it as if it was the official, end-all one, specially considering is based on a fan mv.

18204730900227998;"#opinion El gobierno nunca decepciona y siempre cada semana nos hacen traerles contenido de calidad. Para este fin de semana será el caso de la directora del ICBF Concepción ""Conchita"" Baracaldo, la cual no duro más de aproximadamente 5 meses en el cargo debido a su poca o NULA experiencia en temas de la niñez, sin embargo no fue hasta hace unos días que ella solicito su renuncia, el presidente la acepto y designo a Astrid Cáceres como nueva directora (ciertamente ella si tiene la preparación necesaria).

Realmente Baracaldo junto a MinMinas, MinTransporte, MinSalud y se podría colocar a MinTrabajo demuestran la formula del gobierno en cuanto a contrataciones.

Primer Paso: Amiguismo/Cero Meritocracia/Activismo Político: Básicamente al gobierno le gusta contratar a personas que la primera dama recomienda, sin nula experiencia en el campo o en su defecto personas que estando en el gobierno aun creen que son oposición y sus ministerios parecen en campaña política todavía (Salud).

Segundo Paso, el síndrome de Adán. Básicamente, consiste en que todo lo que se haya en el pasado esta horrible por lo cual hay que hacer un cambio, y cuando no les sale bien el cambio, se escudan en que es dificil mejorar algo luego de años de anteriores gobiernos dañar todo, un clásico de este gobierno. 

Tercer Paso, retractarse de la decisión e hipocresía. En este paso podrán ver como el fanatismo de algunas personas nubla la visión de lo que sucede en el gobierno como la Sra Angela María Robledo que salió con un tweet a dar las gracias por arreglar la embarrada que de entrada no debía suceder. 

Ojo, equivocarse es de humanos, si, pero creemos que tuvieron el tiempo para pensar en una posición tan importante como es el manejo del Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar. Que si es la vecina de la primera dama o la amiga, no es de nuestro interés siempre y cuando este capacitada y se vea reflejado en el manejar de la institución.

In the Weeds
Author: B.K. Borison

Rating:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Notes: This is Book 2 in the Lovelight Farms series and while it can be read as a standalone, I’m definitely recommend reading book 1 first for maximum feels! 

What I Liked:
🌻 This book is pure slow burn, sweet romantic love (which is kind of a juxtaposition since they technically have already had a one night stand prior to the story taking place). The simplest touch or hand hold makes me want to scream at Beckett and Evie to take a leap and share how they feel. 

🌻I love that Evie is trying to find herself and what makes her happy throughout the story. It’s reaffirming to recognize that just because something makes lots of money, doesn’t always mean it’s the best course of action. Your heart being happy is the best thing! 🥰

🌻This town is filled with the very best and most hilarious crew. I hope we get many more adventures in this small town!

What I Didn’t Like:
🌻There’s a miscommunication trope in the third act and it would (and should) have been easily solved if these two knuckleheads said how they felt. I get that it’s a common trope, but it’s never my favorite. Still absolutely adored this book though!

Final Thoughts: 
🌻 I’ve already started the third book in the series, Mixed Signals. These books are pure delight and longing. Any fan of hallmark, smalltown romance, or slow burns will love these books!

#justfinishedreading ""The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari"" by Robin Sharma. The first time I attempted to read this book was when I was in my early twenties. Back then, I was not interested in self-help books and I gave up after first 15 pages or so. A few years ago, I got a copy as a gift. And I finally read it on my Kindle now.

The concept is good and the message important. I know it's a bestseller and very popular. But I felt that it could have been better written or plotted. Julian, a hotshot lawyer renounces his lavish and reckless life when he suffers from a massive heart attack. He travels to India, finds the ageless monks in the Himalayas, learns the virtues of living life fully on a condition that he would return to his world and spread their message.

Julian comes back in a healthy, happier and a younger avatar and meets his mentee John, who has become a workaholic. John listens to Julian's story, advice and message for 12 hours (which started late evening) straight, without any kind of  break. Is such enthusiasm and absorption of knowledge without being overloaded possible? John's thoughts and Julian's words also become repetitive.

I liked the reminders about how we should live each day. The idea of our mind being a garden, which needs tending and caring, removal of weeds (negative thoughts) so that flowers can bloom🌷

Surprisingly, the author presented Oscar Wilde 's ""The Selfish Giant"" as a story set in North India.

VERDICT: Important message conveyed, but more well-written books on the theme available.

🤎""There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. From struggle comes strength. Even pain can be a wonderful teacher.""

17974806037961795;"Possible unpopular opinion…this book was…lacking. 

When I first started this series I was very confused because it’s quite mature for what I thought was a young adult book and I’ve since realized they are adult fantasy romance. I understand that there are certain things that come with that age group and genre, I get it. It’s not my favorite, but I loved the story so much! I gobbled up all four books in a few weeks and maybe it’s because I went through them so quickly, but this book felt like she was trying to push a lot of limits and I mean a lot. 

The substance in the plot and story was lacking and I just felt like every time she could have advanced the story we were breaking for yet another ill-timed naughty scene. So. Many. Scenes. It got to the point where I was just fast forwarding through a bunch of scenes and rolling my eyes at others. I get it. Poppy was sheltered as the Maiden and has since undergone a sexual awakening and isn’t embarrassed or ashamed of any of those thoughts anymore. We are told this too many times for me to count. 

Overall, I’m so disappointed. I will keep reading the series unless the next book is too horrible to continue, but I hope instead of pushing the boundaries of what Poppy and her readers are comfortable with, she starts pushing for the best story and plot possible.

17955490298195944;"Чтобы делать то, что любишь, не обязательно быть лучшим.

Не так давно у меня состоялся душевный диалог с таксистом😅 Он спросил, куда я еду. Я ответила, что на учебу. Ну и слово за слово, он начал расспрашивать у меня про балет🙈 Потом и про то, занимаюсь ли я чем-то еще. А я, естественно, очень много чем занимаюсь, хотя на первый взгляд может показаться, что балет - 100% моего времени. Так вот таксист заметил, что «распыляться» - это неправильно, и спросил меня:

«А Вы не боитесь, что из-за всего этого не станете лучшей?»

Я, конечно, развернула философскую телегу на этот счет, но как-то вот так наш увлекательный диалог прервался. Мне кажется, что мы не очень поняли друг друга (ну по крайней мере он меня😁).

Так вот все это долгое предисловие к чему, а к тому, насколько оказывается для человека важен факт быть лучшим (или стремится к этому).

Давайте разберём две фразы:

1. «Я люблю балет»
Мне нравится танцевать, подбирать новые упражнения, изучать свое тело, вживаться в образ, искать интересные формы. Это увлекает меня, это позволяет мне проживать как будто множество жизней одновременно. Балет (и танец в целом) дает мне возможность проявить не характéрные для меня эмоции (особенно на харáктерном классе🤣). Я буду делать то, что приносит мне удовольствие, и воздержусь от насилия над собой.

2. «Я хочу стать лучшей в балете»
Мне необходимо признание, я не ощущаю самоценность без сверх достижений. Моя самооценка исходит не из внутреннего чувства, а складывается на основе мнения окружающих. Поскольку цель полностью завязана на моей личности, то ее необходимо достигнуть любой ценой, иначе пропадает смысл жизни, исчезаю я, как персона.

Ощущаете разницу? И чувствуете, где истинное желание?

И самое смешное, что вот этот фактор «лучшести» настолько размыт…";2023-01-19 21:29:51+00:00;2023-03-27 14:39:04.435748+00:00;5;98;ru

17988868300648377;"Работать на процесс, а не на результат. Часть II.

Практическое применение полученных знаний из предыдущего поста😅

По большему счету в наши нейронные сети мозга можно заложить совершенно любую информацию. Безусловно, если закладывать суждения лишенные логики и опыта, то проблемы неизбежны. Но если найти разумное подкрепление тому, что должно стать частью вашей новой картины мира, то дальше в ход идет метод «самая обаятельная и привлекательная». Вербальное воздействие - мощный способ для формирования новых нейронных сетей. Иными словами: если вы хотите убедить себя в какой-то очевидной вещи, то просто найдите весомые аргументы, а затем всякий раз, когда мозг начнет по старым установкам заставлять вас думать иначе, проговаривайте себе то, что будет противоречить древней и неактуальной информации.

1. Начните анализировать, что конкретно вам нравится кроме финишной прямой. Кстати, если в деле вас привлекает лишь завершающий элемент, то это повод задуматься. Какие детали придают вам сил, а какие части напротив сказываются на состоянии не лучшим образом (да, да, даже в любимой работе что-то может не устраивать). Сосредоточтесь на плюсах, но и займитесь минусами: что действительно необходимо «терпеть», и чего можно избежать.
2. Задайтесь вопросом «А почему мне так важно именно ПОКОРИТЬ вершину, а не насладиться этапом ПОКОРЕНИЯ?» (здесь, как всегда, техника «5 вопросов» в помощь, ищите в закрепленных историях). Возможно вы ощущаете самоценность лишь тогда, когда достигаете чего-то, возможно вы пытаетесь заслужить любовь своими действиями, возможно вам необходимо быть замеченными и еще 1001 причина, которая мешает быть здесь и сейчас.
3. Еще один из мощнейших страхов: «Если я перестану ставить себе цели, то я вообще перестану работать». И здесь сразу вопрос: «А зачем тогда вы работаете сейчас?». Ну и возвращаемся ко второму пункту🙈
4. Постарайтесь переформатировать свое сознание: рабочий процесс - не рутина, а КВЕСТ. Вы выполняете ежедневно маленькие задания и проходите игру.

И цитата для вас в комментариях👇🏻";2022-12-04 08:56:21+00:00;2023-03-27 14:39:04.435748+00:00;7;75;ru

17847343130732238;"📚Book Review⁣📚
⁣
One Night On The Island, by Josie Silver, features Cleo and Mack, two people lost in their present. Cleo is a dating columnist who hasn’t found her soul mate, and Mack is separated from his wife and desperately missing his two young sons. They both end up on a remote island off the coast of Ireland thinking they will be alone in a cottage for one. As fate would have it, they are both booked in the same cabin and neither wishes to leave. So begins a push and pull, give and take, until the possibilities of something new begins to take shape. ⁣
⁣
Unpopular opinion alert, I did not like this book. The beginning gave me hope for a sweet gentle love story, but the reality of this situation did not ring true for me. I did like Mack as a character and found his discussions of fatherhood profound and moving, while the island residents were aptly quirky and appealing. The big miss for me was Cleo. I found her journey and character annoying and grating, a self- help novice stumbling into loving herself by falling in love. It felt disjointed and out of sync with the intentions I thought the book was trying to illuminate. I loved Silver’s two other books, so maybe this is just me being in a bad mood. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book. ⁣
⁣
I have personally always been in love with visiting an island. I loved geography as a kid and use to draw islands and imaging living there. ⁣
⁣
❓If you could visit any island, which would you choose?⁣
⁣
Prince Edward Island is my top choice. ⁣

📚Book Review📚: The Mary Shelley Club by Goldy Moldavsky
🌟rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️💫/5

🚨 Unpopular Opinion Alert 🚨 

Coming in hot with back to back unpopular opinion reviews this weekend! 😬 This was an entertaining YA book with a fun cast of characters but it didn’t quite live up to all the hype for me. I loved two of the side characters (hey Thayer and Saundra 👋🏻) and the MC Rachel grew on me as the book went on, but I had some major pacing issues. The book starts out super strong and while it’s 468 pages, it reads quickly. However, it did feel super long in the middle of the book with a bit too much of the day-to-day YA drama and I found myself counting how many pages were left until suddenly it picked back up for a fast finish. 
🔪
There are a lot of twists but I think horror movie fans will be able to predict many of them. I’d say this is more of a psychological thriller than a horror book, but I do think fans of horror will like the shoutouts to older horror films. 3.5/5⭐️ 
🔪
This was actually my first buddy read with my bestie Lindsay reading.rambo … all the way back in July, when we read it 😂😂 Now I’m gonna pretend that I was just saving it for spooky season, but that’s definitely a lie. Anyone else post books 3+ months after you read them or are you normal?

The Ex Hex 
Erin Sterling
⭐️⭐️💫 (2.5 stars)

okay, unpopular opinion time. i really don’t understand why this book was so hyped up. when i wasn’t bored and spacing out, i was cringing at something one of the characters said or did. 

here are some problems I had with the book:

- they dated for 3 months and couldn’t stop thinking about each other for 9 years after they broke up….huh? are they okay?
- plot holes. so many plot holes.
- every character is one-dimensional
- the sex scenes weren’t even remotely sexy 
- everything that came out of Rhys’ mouth made me want to throw up 
- the magic sex cave?????
- i don’t understand why it was necessary to make the cat start talking

okay, so there’s my hot take🔥 maybe I just had high expectations since it’s so popular, but this one didn’t live up to the hype for me at all. I also didn’t really enjoy the last book I read by the same author (The Wife Upstairs), so I just don’t think her writing style is for me.

with that being said, it was a quick read and was perfect for Halloween. also, Graves Glen sounds like such a fun town to live in! I really enjoyed the cozy fall vibes of Vivi’s family’s store🍂";2021-10-27 21:31:55+00:00;2023-03-27 14:39:04.435748+00:00;56;555;en

✯✯✯.5 [3.5/5]

How do I rate a book that I absolutely loved (and genuinely thought would be a 5 🌟) until reaching the last page that left me feeling seriously empty? 
It's a hard one, which is why it's taken me a little while to write this review.
•
The book is set in the 1950s in the suburbs of East London. (I don't usually read books set in this time period but I think I'll start reading it more as I really loved the style of writing.) Our main character, 40 year old Jean Swinney is a journalist for a local paper, I really loved Jean and I was so invested in her life/story. Jean lives with her mother who can be quite difficult at times which leaves her with little to no time for herself/personal life. 
This is until a young woman, Gretchen Tilbury contacts the paper to claim that her daughter is the result of a virgin birth & it is down to Jean to find out whether she is a miracle or a fraud. Jeans' life turns inside out following this investigation and she is suddenly given an unexpected chance at friendship, love and possibly happiness but there will be a price to pay.
•
It was a beautiful story, one that I found myself super invested in. So many characters in this I loved (apart from Martha who I found to be quite rude.) It was such a unique story which kept my eyes glued to the page but like I said earlier, I was really not fond of that ending. I felt as if my heart was ripped out and there is no way to repair it. I have seen very mixed reviews (about the ending) so I hope if you do read this that you enjoy it more than me. 

What are you thoughts on this one? I'm curious 💭

17994219748776329;"This weeks Unpopular Opinion might ruffle some feathers.

“Sport Specialization”

Just like my last unpopular opinion, I was a firm believer that kids would be better at a sport if they focused ONLY on one sport. However, as many studies have proven, specializing in a single sport too early can lead to burnout and eventually quitting.

Each sport or athletic activity serves its own useful purpose and I believe that each of those sports (training properly) can aid the other. Especially if one of those sports strengthens the weaknesses of another.

But ultimately, kids should experiment with different sports while they are young and at a point where they are able to adapt to each of those sports.

Let kids try different things and see how one activity benefits the other.

There comes a time when specializing might be the desired path to focus on developing a skillset beyond that of just the average athlete in any given sport…but 18 months to 12 years old is not that time.

Try more. Do more. And see where it might let the kids go.

“What cheesy thing did you say to her about fish & beaches & shores?”
😮‍💨🐯

Dear Diary,

Could I've chosen a better quote from #ISWU to start with? Yes, I could've, but anyways you'll be seeing a plethora of them on other #BoookBloggers's post with them simping over it, so here's my anti-romantic choice.🤣 

I guess everyone knows what the story's about, but I'm gonna use my word count to say—it's the happy ending every It Ends With Us fan was waiting for—Lily & Atlas together finally.

IEWU was a good read for me, but was I anticipating the sequel? Tbh, after series of failed CoHo reads I definitely had zero expectations & guess what??!! The book successfully delivered me my 0 expectations.😌

What I liked? Hmm...there were instances of good bonding between the characters & Lily's thoughts of Ryle, their relationship & the narcissist manipulator he is. I oh so loved seeing him being held accountable for, because that's one of the things IEWU didn't do well. And I'll ask people to stop being Ryle apologists for once & for all. 

What I didn't like? Everything else about the book.🙃 The first 2 chapters had my hopes raised a bit but alas, the immediate pages made me want to fall asleep.😴 The interactions between the characters felt forced & there was no actual chemistry between Lily & Atlas, except for them trauma bonding. The plot twist regarding Atlas's past & a present addition, (to me) seemed as an attempt to excruciatingly add pages to the book & the lack of actual plot development was imminent. 

Atlas as a secondary character wooed me better than a main & I'm pretty disappointed by that. He's a great guy (I know) but he was way too perfect, bordering on unrealistic actions & he's definitely been put on the pedestal for doing bare minimum. 

There's one more new character—Theo—a 12yo, who seemed to be the only sane person but even his & Atlas's conversations were cringe. Who the heck shares their love problems with a 12yo? 🤷‍♀️ Was I supposed to be awwed at their talks? Well, sorry I don't feel emotions well.

CONT'D👇

18166641862201605;"Reminders of Him 🕊 | review

Okay, I haven’t read all of the CoHos (yet) but I just found this one to be such a different vibe! Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoyed it, it was just different than whatever expectation I arbitrarily came up with in my head. I’m not going to do a full blown review because despite sitting on this review for a couple of weeks I’m still not sure where my head is at with it. However, here come some quick thoughts:

• It made me smile, it made me sad, it made me quiver and it hit home for me in some unexpected ways (I went in knowing nothing). 
• I got some Nicholas Sparks vibes (who I’m a sucker for so this is not necessarily a bad thing)
• Some elements of the story felt a bit unrealistic to me, or much too rushed to be realistic
• ‘Twas a bit predictable, though this didn’t bother me too much, I just buckled in for the ride 
• I did not love the weird tokenism that was plugged into this book seemingly in an attempt to hit a diversity check mark
Loved the relationship between Ledger and his best friends family and little girl 

In sum: 
This was a story of great love and great loss, of suffering, resilience and forgiveness. It explored grief and the mess that it can be and it tugged on your heart strings in both happy and sad ways.

If you’ve loved and lost this one may be heavy for you, but may also be cathartic in other ways. Feel free to message me if you have any questions ahead of reading 💛

“Maybe it doesn’t matter whether something is a coincidence or a sign. Maybe the best way to cope with the loss of the people we love is to find them in as many places and things as we possibly can. And in the off chance that the people we lose are still somehow able to hear us, maybe we should never stop talking to them.”

I always said I’m gonna breastfeed my baby for a long time and it’s gonna be so wonderful. And although there has been a lot of endearing moments and sweet memories made, there has also been a lot of frustration, some tears, several moments of being completely touched out, sleepless nights and currently some resentment building. I didn’t want to quit but realized I can’t push it… it’s time to wean. But my question now is HOW? 
.

How do I wean as a SAHM? I can’t leave for work for 8-12 hours to help with this transition. But not that it would matter because the nights are the WORST. Maddox wants me all hours of the night. Try to let him cry it out but it doesn’t work (or I just don’t last very long) and so I give him a boob and we fall asleep. And then I wake up and put him in his crib and 15 minutes later he’s crying to get back on and I want to scream. We always talk about how to breastfeed and how to keep the supply flowing but how do I make it stop?! I need help.

Unpopular opinion ahead…

Rating: ★★★☆☆ (2.75)

I cannot put a finger on WHY I didn’t love this book! The beginning completely hooked me. I thought the writing was great. These characters were all written so well, with the author seeming to have a full grasp on who they were individually.

Unfortunately, there wasn’t anything about this that stood out to me. After the first part of the story gives way to other characters, though, it felt like a completely different book.

I kind of enjoyed the “reveal”, though I was able to call it from early on. I am just saddened that I couldn’t connect with this one like so many others have.

Rating: 7/10

Everyone is TOXIC

I know it is a classic. I even had to read it for English literature back when I had that as a subject. I revisited this story recently and OH MY GOD

I love Emily's writing and how smart she was to pretend that the narrator was a man, when almost the entire story was told by Miss Nelly Dean. ICONIC

But literally everyone is toxic. Most of them to the point where I don't care what happens to them, or I'm like ""Please be unalived"". But despite that fact I had so much fun reading it. I cannot explain it. It's probably, because of how well the book is written itself.

Definitely give a read. I don't think you'd regret it

It ends with us è un romance che vorrebbe essere di più ma resta bloccato nel suo genere. Il tema della violenza domestica, centrale in questa storia, viene svilito dal contorno che l’autrice crea, inserendo contenuti semi-erotici, personaggi stereotipati e una protagonista che assomiglia tanto alla Bella di Twilight, all’Anastasia di Cinquanta sfumature di Grigio e a mille altre “eroine” femminili che sembrano fatte tutte con lo stampino.

Lily ha 23 anni, è inconsapevolmente bellissima e ha appena partecipato al funerale di suo padre, da sempre violento con la madre, quando incontra Ryle, neurochirurgo dai bicipiti d’oro che la travolge in una passione focosa. Tutto sembra filare liscio fino a quando Ryle non inizia a assumere atteggiamenti aggressivi che spaventano Lily e fino a quando Atlas, il primo amore di Lily, non ricompare per caso a sconvolgere il suo universo. Lily si ritrova così intrappolata in una relazione tossica, dove la violenza inizia a fare capolino, dalla quale però non riesce ad uscire, riscrivendo la stessa identica storia della madre tanti anni prima.

Il romanzo è scorrevole e piacevole, il problema è la costante Harmony che si respira tra le pagine. Tutto accade velocemente, senza un filo logico, arrivando ad una conclusione piuttosto scontata. La violenza viene attribuita al classico personaggio del bello e impossibile, per il quale ci si concentra più sulla bellezza e passionalità rispetto alla psicologia di un’anima tormentata che combatte con i propri demoni e cerca di cambiare. 

Le ultime pagine del libro sono invece bellissime: Collen si mette a nudo e racconta la sua esperienza personale con la violenza domestica e ci fa chiedere perché questo libro non l’abbia dedicato alla sua di storia. Sarebbe stato tutto molto più credibile, intenso e vero.

Unfortunately…

Traditional reading comprehension methods…

Which you learned in school…

Just don’t work here.❌

You know why?

Because Copywriting is like a foreign language…👽

It’s a hidden sense or subtext…

That speaks directly to the reader’s emotions.🐢

And…

Just like any foreign language…

You can’t learn merely by reading it…👨🏻‍🎓

For example…

Even if you read all the Spanish novels in the world…

Still you won’t understand anything about the Spanish…🙆🏻‍♀️

✴️Without a way to translate it!!!✴️

This is why reading doesn't help until you translate or decode it.

There are two types of reading…

1️⃣ Passive reading (you read a copy and say “wow, it’s a good copy”, “Nice copy”.)

2️⃣ Active reading (you read a copy…notice the lead, the agitation, the urgency, the persuasion tactics or behind the scenes of copy)

This is why it’s essential to learn at least the basics of copywriting…

And then actively read copy to improve and learn more.📚

🧨The good thing is…🧨

💠 If you “actively” read copy…

💠 You will slowly and naturally learn the copy as well…

💠 Just like watching some Netflix series…

💠 Will make you guess the next scene (though not 100% right😕)

💠 Because of constant exposure to the story, your mind starts recognizing the pattern/plot

💠 Hence it can guess the next

Same happens with copywriting…

📌 After you “binge” enough copy…

📌 The words will flow from you naturally

So…

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲 𝐢𝐬> Learn the basics of copywriting. Wear the spy glasses and start reading copy with an intention to specifically find the sale triggers/copy techniques.

If I had a dollar for every time someone had suggested or promoted artificial intelligence in my business, marketing, website content and script writing because WoRk SmArTeR nOt HaRdER…
I would be investing in a multi-plex right now.

Here’s the thing about it. My clients work with me for ME. Not for ChatGPT or Jasper or WALL-E or Vicki from Small Wonder. 

When you ask me questions, sometimes I might tell you I need to research the answer. Sometimes I might tell you it’s a better question for your lawyer, CPA, or mortgage lender. And sometimes, most often, I do know the answer and I can answer from my 🧠 and 🫀and experience in real estate. I don’t believe in automating content for my clients or prospects because YOU ARE NOT ALL THE SAME. Some of you need things explained like you’re five 🖐🏻 and some of you need the Cliff’s Notes version. Some of you have never bought a home and some of you are seasoned investors. 

I won’t lie, I checked out all the apps, mostly because I’m kind of a tech nerd and my background in digital marketing made it all pretty intriguing. 

But here’s my unpopular opinion… if a real estate agent can’t think of what to say, they might be in the wrong career. I can’t, for the life of me, figure out why someone who is in the business of communication and negotiation, would use artificial intelligence to create informative marketing. AI is watering down the market with generic, thoughtless content and making everyone who uses it look the same, and those who don’t, stand out.

So my promise is that every caption, every response, every email, and every bit of my content will be written by me, a real, imperfect-but-trying-my-best, human. 

I know this is a hot take. I know all of you who are using it “edit it to make it sound like me!” and I know it’s efficient. What I also know, is it’s not for me.

Signing out now, to go work on content about The Art of the Home Swap. Stay tuned for a guide written by a human.*

I’m pretty sure this book was on everyone’s radar this year. I have to say I liked it, but didn’t LOVE it. I think there was just so much hype that it didn’t live up to in my opinion. If I had picked it up without hearing all the rave reviews it probably would have landed differently. The protagonist Olga was likable and I really appreciated her grit. I also really loved the Puerto Rican history intertwined in the storytelling. There were however some side stories that I thought were unnecessary and ultimately distracting.

I know this book is being developed into a series for #hulu with Aubrey Plaza as the lead. Really intrigued to see how the story is adapted for the series. I think there is a lot to work with and I can’t wait to see how it all comes together.

#TwinFlame union is separate from a #DivineCounterpart or #RevolutionaryCounterpart Union. Let's discuss. 👀😏

BOTH of these connections/encounters are DETRIMENTAL to your Ascension. 
BOTH are Love Interests. 
BOTH are Inevitable Encounters.
BOTH are orchestrated by Source; The Most High; your Higher Self before this Lifetime began.

However....

#TwinFlames and #TwinFlame are manifested and  encountered in order to physically (3D Realm) show you that version of Self as an Opposite Sex*.
They are your current state of your #InnerFeminine or #InnerMasculine manifested outside of your body.
At the point of meeting them in the Physical World, you have attracted them based on the fact that you thought or were taught to believe that a #TwinFlameJourney was the ULTIMATE, END GOAL PARTNER.
❗THIS IS NOT TRUE ❗
Yet, the misconception of this TwinFlame Journey was INTENDED TO MAKE YOU THINK THAT THIS CONNECTION WAS THE END GOAL PARTNER.

Why?

So that when you meet your current polar opposite yet mirrored current version of your Soul in a Feminine or Masculine Aspect, you were SUPPOSED to temporarily  wholeheartedly believe that this is who you were Spiritually Married to, so that you would FULL FORCE put all your effort into applying the wisdom and knowledge learned up until that point to make the relationship* work.

You BOTH genuinely thought/think that this is ""My Person""!
""They're just like me, but the opposite sex!""
""We have the same interests, we even look alike!""

Manifesting a fellow Twin Flame believer who seems to be mirroring you and vice versa allows you to work on yourself, in 3rd Person, essentially; by observing this person. By expressing Self authentically, asking questions, learning one another. Assisting, guiding, submitting to one another. Being one another's calm during the storm. Being okay with ""rushing in"" to ""finally unite"", physically. There's a sense of Contentment, and Healing and Realization happens.

17931372688742572;"qotd: What do you do when you don’t really like a book that #bookstagram adored⁉️

Let me start by saying I love Casey McQuiston and “Red, White and Royal Blue” but woooh, this book needed some heavy edits. It was just one of those reads that when I put it down it never really called my name to pick it back up. I didn’t dislike it by any means, I just wasn’t compelled to finish it.

I mean when you start a book in July but don’t finish it until October…that says something doesn’t it? Tbf, I have been overwhelmed at work and personal stuff, so maybe this just didn’t help me escape like I wanted it too. Loved the concept but the execution just wasn’t my favorite. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Casey’s work is still important for inclusivity sake alone, and I will forever consider her an auto-buy but this one just wasn’t for me.

17922140672092868;"⭕ UNPOPULAR OPINION ⭕

The Reading List by Sara Nisha Adams is a book that I buddy read with Simran (craartology1802 ) and it's the one that failed to stand for its word or I should probably say blurb. 🙄

Aleisha and Mukesh are two people with massive age difference, each having their own past. Aleisha working at a library in Wembley comes across a reading list and they end up reading and talking about the books together. 

The plus points of the book in my opinion are a few and they are : 

• The theme of books and reading bringing people closer is heartwarming.

• Bookish metaphors and direct comparisons mainly related to the book that is talked about in a particular instant are made which were a little fun. 

• The beautiful cover of the book.

However, there are multiple reasons I disliked it : 

• Painstakingly slow, dry plot which makes the reader go crazy upto two thirds of the book for it makes very very less sense. 

• Simran and I trudged through the book in hopes of finding who had made the list which was entirely predictable. 

• The writing is just average which, based upon the hype the book had gotten, was one of the most disappointing things about reading it. 

• Improper/ Inadequate character development and plethora of unnecessary characters made the book a cumbersome read. 

• Pages full of unnecessary details (over descriptive writing) made me ask Simran what am I to do with this information. 

• The page count is that of 422 and thats draining specially when the writing is not engaging at all. 

The theme that the book is based upon had a lot of potential for its something readers love to read about but the way it was carried out was what killed the entire essence of the book. I really expected a lot from this title. Alas! The Reading List proved to be the biggest disappointment book wise.

 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Day 7 with inversion - and one I haven’t done in a while for instagram the stag legs headstand. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Yesterday’s question I asked brought many giggles which made me smile so much 😆 so I wanted to find another #unpopularopinion type of question. So what best than bringing black tea ☕️ into the conversation. Tea is something that the English found in India and brought back home this magical leaf that makes water taste amazing and gets your brain stimulated. I have been drinking tea since childhood - I know now apparently kids are not allowed to have it but don’t think I grew up badly while having tea. So here we go… milk 🥛 in tea… my aunt and grandmother (both Russian) would not have milk in their tea. It was black with sugar or without when having biscuits. But see my dad is English. So milk was offered to me being the daughter of my dad. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The Russian style is to brew the tea in the teapot - loose leaf is higher quality and shows wealth. We also have a whole kitchen type of appliance thing called Samavar - where you brew litres of tea and it has a little tap at the bottom to re-fill your cute pretty cup. And you can have that with Kanfetki - sweets like Aliona and Malina etc. or biscuits , cake, even nuts and dry fruits. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Again I remind you I saw milk being added to tea in childhood so my way to make tea in a mug is:
1️⃣ boil water and prepare a mug with your black tea teabag inside and amount of sugar or honey if adding that. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
2️⃣ pour boiling water over the teabag and let it brew for a few minutes. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
3️⃣ add dash of milk - or amount you need and stir all together. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
4️⃣ remove teabag without squeezing it because it gets the bitterness into the mix otherwise. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
5️⃣ enjoy your tea - don’t just leave your teabag in the sink ! I see you ! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Happy Sunday all. 🐑 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

17903950496174019;"Can we talk about the trendy topic of ‘shadow work’ for a minute please?

 Karl Jung defined the shadow as a counterpoint to the persona. He describes the persona as “what oneself as well as others thinks one is”. The shadow, in contrast, is “the thing a person has no wish to be”. And yet we ARE that thing, it is an intrinsic part of us. 

Jung believed failure to acknowledge this part of ourselves leads to it expressing itself in subversive ways, such as addiction, projection, hypocrisy etc. 

Let’s think about what a shadow self is. What DON’T you wish to be? 

What I, personally, don’t wish to be is a manipulative arsehole, a professional victim, or someone who believes their own fragile mental health entitles them to special treatment so that they can finally, for once in their lives, feel special. Some of these, in fact, are the things I resent most in other people, and I feel that I am well-placed to judge and condemn them. 

Guess what I found I was hiding from everyone, mainly myself, when I finally took inventory of myself? Hint: all of the above.

The next step is integration. This involves recognising what you are capable of, and accepting it, and not trying to “heal” it or transform it or make it go away. In my case, I found that just as I am capable of being a caring and protective person, I am also capable of manoeuvring myself into a position of victimhood to avoid an oncoming confrontation and therefore accountability. Am I truly a victim? Maybe, sometimes, but believe it or not it doesn’t actually matter.

This part of me will never go away - the difference is that now I recognise it & don’t fear it, I can choose not to act on it. That makes me a healthier person than if I remained blind to myself by blaming external factors or people without looking at my own role. 

I see a lot of journal suggestions for shadow work such as “what does your inner child need to heal?” & “what would you say to the person that hurt you most?” Calling this shadow work bypasses the actual work. 

Shadow work won’t make you feel better, or heal you. It just makes you more whole. 

For more on shadow work, I recommend checking out lonerwolfpath’s excellent guide.";2021-09-08 14:40:39+00:00;2023-03-27 14:39:10.516573+00:00;99;1733;en

The Rom-Com Agenda 
Author: Jayne Denker

Rating:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Note: I received a copy of this book to review via NetGalley, but all opinions are my own. 

What I Liked:
🧢while reading this book I found myself laughing and smiling at the mention of every single Rom Com. I might have even made my own little “to watch” list even though I’ve seen them all a 100 times. There is something so pure and lovely about a Rom Com that makes you laugh, cry, and generally feel good inside. 

🧢The contrast between Eli’s relationship with Victoria and Leah is obvious to the reader but not to him. As the story unfolds, and it becomes clearer, you as a reader can’t helps but get butterflies in your tummy thinking of will they won’t they. 

What I Didn’t Like:
🧢This Book was surprisingly heavier and more emotional than I had anticipated. There are mentions of cancer, death of a parent, and foster children. Not easy things to read about. While they were beautiful written, they could still be hard for some reader so please be sure to keep that in mind. 

Final Thoughts: 
🧢 Overall this was a sweet and emotional ride. Fade to black scenes make this a pretty wholesome read as well. I really enjoyed this heartwarming read and think that fans of Hallmark movies will enjoy this as well!

17962256339297301;"UNPOPULAR OPINION TIME ‼️ 
⚠️ this review contains spoilers ⚠️ 

To start, I’m giving this book 2 stars and that’s probably generous. 

But alright y’all. We gotta talk about how problematic this story is. It’s the stereotypical “I can fix him” story line. GIRLFRIEND NO YOU CANT. THE MAN NEEDS THERAPY AND A LOT OF IT. Tate and Miles’ relationship is SO toxic from the start. He literally refuses to tell her anything about himself other than the fact that he’s a pilot and has been friends with her brother, Corbin, since flight school. Corbin only tries to protect Tate from having her heart broken, she ignores him and ends up with exactly that. The writing/page formatting of Miles’ chapters were awful- nothing about the reason for having them center page made sense. Not only that, but throughout the whole book, the sentences were choppy and nothing flowed well. None of the characters really had any personality characteristics outside of their professions. I understand that Rachel left him as soon as everything with Clayton happened and they never worked through their trauma together but Miles refusing to ever move on from that doesn’t make sense to me. He needed to have been seeing a therapist or at least finding a way to work through his trauma in a healthy manner. Instead, he completely shut himself off to the world and refused to let anyone in. I can’t imagine the kind of pain you go through losing a child, so I can’t put myself in that headspace. I have to imagine, though, that your need someone to lean on and help you move forward with life. In the end, he pulls his head out of his ass and ends up with Tate, but IMO he doesn’t deserve her! Not only that, but in the epilogue it seems like he never completely moved past his trauma until Sam is born. I don’t know y’all I just did not like this book. If you’re on the CoHo train, skip this one.

I'm not a big fan of the holiday altogether, in my opinion it's purely commercial. But I really don't see why small children would make Valentine's cards for their ""sweetheart"". Children in primary school should be learning how to make friends, not having drama over their love not being reciprocated with gifts or cards. 
I know in America they use it as a way to express love for all loved ones, but I think we have plenty of (holi)days for that already.

It did take a bit of research on the Vocaloid DB, but there are a surprising amount of Vocaloid songs in Rayark games (most being indie except for most songs on the Cytus 2 X Miku Collab). Voez in particular seems to be the one that I think makes them shine the most, as most of the time I see songs such as kimi to mita Sora no uta, Tipsy Desert, Obscure Voice and many more songs in the featured section. I’ve also seen songs using Chinese vocaloids and even YOHIOloid as well. I think my favorite has to be Matsurizuki with Kagamine Rin.

No, no eres más animalista ni te gustan más los perros por tener un número más grande de lo habitual :

Verás, los animales no son cosas, ni se cuentan por decenas.
No les ayudas más por acoger perros por encima de tus posibilidades. No eres mejor persona por llevarte a casa cada animal que te encuentras.
👉 No, si no les das la vida que se merecen, con el bienestar social, física y emocional pleno que se merecen.

De nada me vale que tengas 6 perros, 3 gatos y dos tortugas, si no sacas a pasear a los perros, si no llevas a los gatos al veterinario y si no tienes en cuenta la alimentación de la tortuga.

De nada me vale, tampoco, que sigas educando a tu perro como lo hacías hace 30 años porque ""has tenido perro toda la vida y nunca mordieron a nadie"". Mucha gente a la que sus profesores les tiraban de las orejas, pegaban con la regla en las uñas o les hacían estar de pie horas con libros en cada mano, tampoco mataron a nadie ni tienen traumas gravísimos, pero a nadie se le ocurre ahora hacerlo o dejar que se lo hagan a sus hijos.

👉 Evolución educativa. En todos los ámbitos.

“Parlane con qualcuno e vedrai che dopo starai meglio”, “ vedrai che se butti fuori tutto con qualcuno avrai le idee più chiare sulle decisioni che devi prendere”.

Ecco questo secondo me è un altra di quelle idee che abbiamo in testa, che ci vengono ripetute fino alla nausea, ma che in realtà non sono la verità assoluta come crediamo. 

A volte parlare con qualcuno dei nostri problemi o delle sfide che stiamo affrontando non è la soluzione. 

A volte continuare a parlare di quella decisione che dovremmo prendere, non fa altro che metterci davanti ad altre domande senza risposta, e peggiorar la situazione. 

Dovremmo capire che per alcune decisioni alcune scelte importanti della nostra vita dovremmo trovarne una noi, da soli, di soluzione. 

Molte volte per scelte in ambito lavorativo o di relazioni, ci rivolgiamo a qualcuno con le migliori intenzioni per far sì che ci aiutino a trovare le risposte che cerchiamo. 

Ora però, prima di rispondere di impulso, fermati un attimo, e chiediti se ci serve veramente parlarne con quella persona. 

Si perché molte volte lo facciamo solo con la speranza che le persone ci diano la risposta che vogliamo sentirci dire, o che ci dicano quelle cose che noi in cuore nostro sappiamo ma non vogliamo accettare. 

È un discorso molto complesso da riassumere in qualche riga, ma spero ti avrà dato il giusto input per ragionare sul concetto del discorso. 

Abbi il coraggio, la forza, la consapevolezza di determinare l’importanza del parlare di alcune decisioni con le altre persone. 

Molte volte le risposte già le hai, ma non vuoi accettarle. In fin dei conti la vita è sempre la tua e solo tu puoi sapere e trovare fino in fondo la risposta che stai cercando.

People with unwavering certainty have always baffled me. At times I would even question my own values for lack of this undying conviction toward my beliefs. If I am certain of anything it is that I am certain of nothing.

As time goes on and the more I study the greatest minds in history, I realise that certainty is the antithesis of wisdom.

Right now in particular, more people than ever are defending their beliefs with absolute certainty and conviction, unwilling to see or hear anything that contradicts it. The effects of this are obvious.

Just imagine if we treated everyone as if they held a valuable truth that we weren’t yet aware of - if we went into discussions actually open and willing to change our minds. 

If we always sought to find a middle ground of shared humanity, maybe we could bring this divide a little closer together.

18234878539177472;"I was watching that ""Vocaloid and their voice providers"" video, and then I went to the comments, I saw people complaining that they want to know how Flower's original voice provider looks and sounds like. Well, for me to be honest, I'm pretty sure Flower's original voice provider perhaps MIGHT be an underage person (but I'm not very sure if that's true or not). Also, there are some other Vocaloids besides Kaai Yuki and Flower, whom their original voice providers are unknown, such as VY1, VY2, and the list goes on.

17945265389447700;"It's a myth that there is no such thing as bad PR. Hello Southwest Airlines...

While it is true that some attention, whether positive or negative, can generate buzz and increase brand awareness, negative publicity can have serious and long-lasting consequences for a brand's reputation. Negative media coverage, social media backlash, or other types of negative publicity can damage a brand's credibility, erode consumer trust, and hurt sales. 

In some cases, the negative impact of bad PR can be difficult or even impossible to overcome. Part of a PR pro's job is to manage negative publicity and protect their clients' reputation.

I’ve recently gotten into Sumia’s music after hearing this song and it’s amazing. Everything involved with it fits together. The music sounds dark but fantastical. Sumia’s tuning of Miku is also really good!! It’s really smooth and goes great with the music. Kannda Yo’s art and video really fit the song and themes as well. The song runs at only a bit over 2 1/2 minutes but I always have to put it in loop when I listen to it. It’s overall just an amazing piece of music which I really recommend if you’re into darker vocaloid songs and producers. It deserves way more than the 53k views it currently has.

Honestly it’s been a few weeks since I finished them and I still have super mixed feelings. I know some of my bookstagram friends will probably come for me 🤣🤷‍♀️ 

This duet was… DARK. And what it really comes down to is, I think it was TOO dark for me. 

Many of you LOVE these books. But the spice was not for me, and neither was the dark creepy vibes. 

I can appreciate that the writing is WONDERFUL and Sophie Lark is so unique in her writing style, I adored it, so I’ll still try her other books.

17975150896992177;"Modelling isn't the best way to teach AAC. 

Yep, I said it. 

So what happens when modelling? When you are modelling AAC that involves speaking most of the sentence and pressing a few words as you speak. For example, your child is frustrated they can't get a circle to go in a triangular hole and so the parent says out loud (""it goes in the square hole!!"" /j /ref) ""I see you're frustrated maybe you... "" then with the AAC they press ""want help"". Then they help the child. 

Why is this bad? Ultimately, it's super unnatural. Also, if you are doing this on their device, you are teaching them others can touch their voice, that's not ok. 

Well what should we do instead? Think about it, what do you do when you are teaching a baby language, you talk to them in it! Use AAC naturally, on a separate device. Remember that their AAC is an extension of them. ""Do you want some food, what would you like?"", ""Can I play with you?"", ""Could you please help me pick up your toys?"", ""I'm really proud of you for ___"", etc. ON YOUR OWN DEVICE. 

So I guess what I am saying is your concept of modelling isn't the best way, yet! AAC is hard, it takes time to learn. Don't expect your child to pick it up immediately. You have to be confident, you WILL make mistakes. That's ok. We all misspeak sometimes. 

Inspiration for this post in comments.

1. Everyone knows that you can click a website's logo and return to the homepage. Besides, the goal of your homepage is *not* to keep visitors there but to direct them to more useful pages (e.g., services).⁠⁠

Remember, people don't spend much time on websites. Chances are, they're going straight to your services page (/Shop if you're eCommerce).⁠⁠

17938178276451870;"Word...preach it babe 🔥 
Repost from adunholler Call me old-fashioned, but I still believe that all of God's laws and principles remain the same- no matter the era or the generation. There's no 'grace message' that you will preach to me that will help me understand how some of His principles and laws should be overlooked in this present age. I'm sorry, but I would never understand such.

One day, about ten years ago, my friend and l planned to hangout after church service on a Sunday. He attended another church so we decided to meet up in an eatery at a central location. He came with a couple of other friends and in no time, we started gisting and getting to know one another. One conversation led to another and then we started talking about singles and relationships. One of the ladies said (in a rather carefree nature) she regularly has sex with her boyfriend and there's no big deal about it. Infact she said she could never date someone who she wasn't going to be intimate with, as it's a prerequisite for a successful relationship. Several questions flooded my young mind.

More recently I had a colleague who had the very same reasoning as this lady. Her own reason totally shocked me, as I never expected her to say those words. She told me that her pastor encouraged his members to get involved intimately with their partners before marrying them. Infact his popular phrase was 'tested okay'.

God's principles and laws remain the same. A sin is a sin. It is very wrong to engage in sexual immorality. Because most people are doing it doesn't make it approved by God. Because your pastor encourages it doesn't mean God isn't frowning at it. Grace doesn't cover sinful living. Let's be clear on this. 

Sex is only for married couples. 
Sex is only for married couples.
Sex is only for married couples.

Because everyone is doing something does not make it right and because no one is doing it doesn't make it wrong.

""But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people.""
Ephesians 5:3 NIV

18023633296339688;"I know not everyone will agree with me on this one, but hear me out. ⁣
⁣
Most of the time, when we say “the right person, wrong time”, we are saying it out of denial. As a way to emotionally avoid rejection and the reality of the situation, which more often than not, is that the relationship isn’t meant to be. ⁣
⁣
It is easier for us to accept that the timing is off, than admit we just aren’t a good fit, because it feels less personal and it leaves open a door and hope that maybe things could work out down the road. ⁣
⁣
The problem with this, is a) we aren’t accepting reality and b) we aren’t allowing ourselves to fully let go and move on from the relationship by continuing to hold onto false hope. ⁣
⁣
But the reality is, if it was meant to be, it would be. Nothing that is meant for you, will leave you. And if it truly is the right person, timing won’t matter, they will make it work regardless. ⁣
⁣
This is not to say that there aren’t exceptions. Sometimes people do need to grow on their own before they can come back together, healthier than ever. ⁣
⁣
But even in the exceptions, you have to at least let go of the individual temporarily and allow each other the space to grow. ⁣
⁣
If it is meant to be, the Universe, God, whatever you want to call it, will bring you back together. But you can’t force what isn’t meant for you. And you can’t move forward with the past hanging over your head. ⁣
⁣
Be honest with yourself. Stop taking rejection personally and see it for what it truly is, a redirection towards what actually is for you. And allow yourself to let go and move on. ⁣
⁣

A possible unpopular opinion coming forth but I really liked this book… 🤷🏼‍♀️🤩
I think if you’re expecting a real edge of your seat thriller change your expectations but if you’re used to this author's work, it's superb 👏🏻👏🏻

Miriam, Laura, and Clara’s lives are intertwined after the murder of Daniel Sutherland slams their seemingly unconnected worlds together. Why are they all involved? Why is Daniel dead? And, of course, who killed him? 🕵🏻

This book has a LOT of characters to keep straight but once you do it's an amazing read. I thought it was so interesting because there were like four or five mini-stories intertwined with the big murder that made it more enjoyable to read. The ending wasn’t the best and it was quite predictable but I enjoyed it nonetheless. 🤪

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.5

#unpopularOpinion

This book and i had a love hate relationship.
First of all the protagonist was a total perv and a self obsessed narcissist who liked to justify all his actions by thinking that life is not fair and everybody has their secrets.
And unfortunately the story is told from his pov which didn't make him a reliable narrator and also i despised him lol and didn't wanna 'hear him say anything' lmao
Also i figured out who the chalk man was during the first half of the book. 
I've seen a lot of reviews of people saying its fast paced read and even the Storygraph has mentioned it as such, but i think it was pretty slow and you'd have to read many pages before the author gets to the point.
The reason why didn't totally hate this book was because first of all, who doesn't like a murder mystery set in a small creepy town, right? I loved the setting and enjoyed the alternate timeline which switches from 2016 to 1986. 
The characters backstories are written nicely. Also the writing is easy and it has the power to keep you hooked right from the prologue.  Though there are not any 'mind blowing or mind numbing' plot twists, or maybe its just me🤷 idk lol

I read this book awhile ago and just wasn't going to post about it because I saw so many rave reviews, but here we go anyway! (And it's not long but it doesn't deserve much from me)

#QOTD What's your latest unpopular opinion?

𝐉𝐔𝐒𝐓 𝐋𝐈𝐊𝐄 𝐇𝐎𝐌𝐄

MY THOUGHTS:
This is probably the stupidest thing I've ever read. I was hoping for something a little different not this house being a monster and it was just an odd horror for me.

I don't even know what to say other than that. This is why I think horror is stupid. This wasn't scary at all.

The protestant work ethic may value early wake times as a semiotic sign of a hard worker. But we now live in a world where productivity can come on any shift. If waking early feels best for you, go for it. If not, wake when is best for you.

Well, I just don’t see that much of it. There are some YouTube channels I literally subscribe to-JUST for their MMD, and now they just don’t upload anymore. But they probably stopped uploading maybe due to life or other issues. I missed those days when people used MMD, they were very creative with it. And I rarely see Vocaloid producers use MMD as well. They only producers I see use MMD a couple of time back then were Mitchie M  and Hachioji-P. MMD just slowly died as time went on, I’ll be surprised if some still do it today.

Agree or Disagree? Write down in the comments

Admin thoughts: I never really was on the MMD side of the fandom (I have it on my laptop but I use it like twice a year) so I can't judge

***

My, kobiety, nie miałyśmy, nie mamy i zapewne jeszcze długo nie będziemy miały lekko. Od lat musimy zmagać się z wieloma przeciwnościami, przekonaniami, normami społecznymi. Wymaga się od nas dużo, przy jednoczesnym nieprzestrzeganiu zasad równego traktowania i poszanowania tego, co robimy. Główna bohaterka ""Lekcji chemii"" właśnie z tym walczy - tylko czy nie jest to walka z wiatrakami?

Elizabeth Zott to niesamowicie charyzmatyczna bohaterka, której kibicuje się od pierwszych stron. Jest bardzo specyficzną postacią (nie chcę diagnozować jej na siłę, choć mam swoje podejrzenia), ale na pewno nie pozostawia czytelnika obojętnym. Niesamowicie żałuję, że w pewnym momencie moje pozytywne odczucia zostały stłamszone przez mocno wybijającą się schematyczność, a także przeciąganie pewnych wątków kosztem innych, które można byłoby rozwinąć.

Wszyscy wychwalają tę książkę - mnie 2/3 zachwyciły, ale końcowe rozdziały ostudziły entuzjazm, bo wydały mi się zbyt przesłodzone i pisane jakby na kolanie - byle szybciej, byle milej, byle ludzie byli zadowoleni. Oczekiwałam więcej mięsa oraz charakteru, a dostałam taki przeciętny finał, nietrudny do odgadnięcia.

Jako całość - świetna rozrywka skłaniająca do przemyśleń i wywołująca uśmiech na twarzy, ale przy tym ulubieńcem nie zostanie przez brak dopracowania pewnych szczegółów składających się na mój zachwyt.

17960649113239334;"I am just NOT inspired by people who appear to have all their shit together already.

They can be living a life that looks and feels similar to what I desire, and that can be so fun to witness and even add color to my own daydreams, but it doesn’t push me to take action to make it happen for myself.

Instead, it breeds a response of, “That is great…. FOR THEM.”

I don’t see myself in that, because I am NOT there yet. And they can share their story of where they started from and how they got to this beautiful place, but…..

The “how” they got there ends up being so watered down. They are recalling the journey from a completely new energetic space than when they started, so the detail and nuance of the journey is lost.

But you know what does inspire ACTION in me? When the people who are living a life that I desire ALSO share the mindset and energy blocks they are STILL dealing with, as they are moving through them. When they share what is holding them back from their next level, the emotions they are navigating, AND what they are doing to move through or shift them.

When they share what is working really fucking well for them, in that moment, when it is fresh and raw and HAPPENING. When they share every bit of the process, not just the result.

I am COMPLETELY fired up by having a front-row seat to the LIVE show.

Hola 📝 este libro fue la selección del mes en el fs.bookclub y, quizás para sorpresa de muchos pero no para mi, no me gusto. 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
De que va? Narra los amores y desventuras de la señora March y sus cuatro hijas. Bajo la capa de aparente ligereza que le otorga su condición de retrato costumbrista y sus aires de manual de modales para jovencitas, Mujercitas es un entretenido canto a la libertad y la alegría de vivir, sobre todo gracias al personaje de Jo, que sirvió de icono para parte del movimiento feminista.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Que me gusto? Jo, definitivamente es un gran personaje, una chica valiente, adelantada a su tiempo y de gran corazón. El hecho de que se atreviera a decir que quería ser un chico, que hiciera cosas de chicos sin importan lo que digan los demás. 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
A quien lo recomiendo? A todo el que le gusten los libros de Jane Austen. 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Que no me gusto? Toda la historia en general, fue todo muy aburrido, no vi nada de impacto o que me llevara a reflexionar. Siento que el fondo todo gira a sentirse mal por no tener dinero como los demás. 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Si este libro te gusto o es tu favorito, está bien y entiendo el porqué. Simplemente este tipo de historias no son para mi. 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Ya leíste este clásico? Viste la adaptación?

17926118099022010;"📝 RESEÑA 📝

▪️Holiiisss 💁🏻‍♀️ Vengo aquí a dejar la última reseña del año que es una #UnpopularOpinion 😅 así que, que empiece el debate😂

▪️Deslizando la sinopsis ➡️

▪️Escrito a dos voces, de forma sencilla y ágil comenzamos a conocer y sumergirnos en la historia de Margot y David. Una historia llena de personajes carismáticos y chistosos. Situaciones graciosas y un lenguaje bastante cotidiano e incluso en algunos momentos malsonante; no es que me moleste esto, pero siento que en algunas escenas y situaciones sobra y te saca de la historia, pues se pierde musicalidad

▪️No considero que sea una historia o libro que me cambiara la vida, no me emocioné y siento que sobraban páginas, que era repetitivo y que los desarrollos de los personajes no fue algo que sentías, si no que solo leías, pero sí que ha sido entretenida y algunas risas me ha sacado, por lo que se lee de manera rápida.

▪️No llegue a conectar con la protagonista ni con su historia, a decir verdad, con muy pocas partes conecté. Creo que a lo mejor la pluma de la autora no es para mí, aunque reconozco que el tema narrativo en cuanto a ambientación, es muy bueno. 

▪️Se incluyen personajes secundarios con historias interesantes y solo son relleno, no se profundiza y a mí personalmente eso no me ha gustado 🤷🏻‍♀️. No veo la necesidad de darles historias y dejarlos ahí al aire o con resoluciones veloces. 

▪️El cliché que tiene, no se qué decir... de verdad no esperaba nada del libro así que como lectura entretenida ha estado bien 😅 ¿Me gustó? Si ¿Cumplió con el objetivo de entretener? También. ¿Leeré más de la autora? ¡Lo dudo mucho! 

▪️El final tengo que admitir que me gustó, ya se que esa idea de dejarlo abierto no es del agrado de todos pero en este caso para mí lo fue. Viendo también lo apresurado que fue todo de cara a él, no cabía esperar tampoco otro final más elaborado. Siento que fue un cierre a la altura del libro #SorryNotSorry 🤗

▪️¿Y a ti, te gustó? ¿Han leído a la autora? ¿Les gusta que los libros tengan final abierto? 

3/5⭐

“In horror movies, the final girl is the one who's left standing when the credits roll. The one who fought back, defeated the killer, and avenged her friends. The one who emerges bloodied but victorious. But after the sirens fade and the audience moves on, what happens to her?

Lynnette Tarkington is a real-life final girl who survived a massacre twenty-two years ago, and it has defined every day of her life since. And she's not alone. For more than a decade she's been meeting with five other actual final girls and their therapist in a support group for those who survived the unthinkable, putting their lives back together, piece by piece. That is until one of the women misses a meeting and Lynnette's worst fears are realized--someone knows about the group and is determined to take their lives apart again, piece by piece.

But the thing about these final girls is that they have each other now, and no matter how bad the odds, how dark the night, how sharp the knife, they will never, ever give up.” 

uhm, so yeah. I had very high hopes for this book because the concept seemed really interesting and like there would be a ton of twists and surprises. instead of being fascinating and sucking me in, this let me down super hard. there was not a single character that I cared about tbh and all of the action happened in pretty much the first 150 pages and then nothing exciting occurred the second half of the book :/ 

⭐️⭐️2/5 stars

Do you have an #unpopularopinion that you wish was different? Like you dislike something everyone likes but you wish so badly you liked it?

Disney moves are my favorite thing EVER but I don’t love Nightmare Before Christmas 😭 I really wish I did!

Also, doesn’t this dress look like Sally’s dress a little bit? 😍
🪴🪴
Despite that, I requested Long Live the Pumpkin Queen from netgalley and disneybooks because I love sheaernshaw and I really liked it!
I loved that this was a continuation of the movie and not a retelling.
After marrying Jack, Sally becomes overwhelmed by her duties and runs off into the woods. Hidden, she finds a moon shaped door which she realizes she left open once she gets back to Halloweentown and finds everyone asleep.
Sally was a really fun character to follow. She starts out very unsure of herself and her new role as pumpkin queen but gains confidence as the book goes along.
The villain in this book is so creepy. We don’t see a ton of him, but when we do, it gave me the creeps!
We got a lot of Sally’s backstory which was extremely interesting.

17916601225915863;"REVIEW 😮

This is a dark, twisted, and an incredibly binge-able read. I was pretty disturbed while reading, ngl!

Where this fell short for me was the writing and character development. While it's fast paced and intense, I found it predictable as far as thrillers go, repetitive, and lacking an interesting/likeable main character. (wellreadandwellsaid and stephonashelf have great reviews with their thoughts of the character development!)

There is absolutely a shock factor with this book though, so I can see why it's so popular! It just fell short for me in a few ways. 

This is an unpopular opinion though, so I would still recommend it to anyone interested in reading it, there are so so many people who loved it. Definitely check out content warnings too!";2021-10-19 12:18:08+00:00;2023-03-27 14:39:16.558702+00:00;17;562;en
17945883797282838;"Eines der Bücher, die hier auf bookstagram wohl am häufigsten besprochen wurden. ""Dschinns"" von Fatma Aydemir ist ein Feuerwerk der Themen. Über Rassismus und Sexismus über die Kämpfe um die eigene Emanzipation und Freiheit innerhalb der Gesellschaft und der eigenen Familie, bis hin zur türkisch-deutschen und kurdisch-türkischen Geschichte. Das Buch stellt eine Familie in den Fokus, die schon lange am zerbrechen ist. Der plötzliche Tod des Familienvaters bringt sie nach langem wieder zusammen und schnell wird deutlich: all das, was nie ausgesprochen wurde droht zu explodieren. Der Familie werden ihre Risse bewusst. Doch lassen sie sich noch reparieren, oder ist die große Tragödie mit dem Tod nicht schon längst besiegelt? 🙇🏻‍♂️

Hochgelobt wurde dieses Buch von wirklich vielen, vielen Seiten. Entsprechend hoch waren natürlich die Erwartungen und was soll ich sagen? Das Buch konnte dem einfach nicht gerecht werden. Der Schreibstil ist gut und passt sich den einzelnen Perspektiven der Kapitel an, aber die Menge der Themen war einfach viel zu viel für die Länge des Buches. Vieles wurde nur kurz angeschnitten und wirkte sehr deplatziert. Selbst einige Charaktere wirkten eher, als ob sie ""für die Quote"" hineingeschrieben wurden, wirkten nicht echt und erhielten nicht den Platz, der ihnen zugestanden hätte um sie natürlicher wirken zu lassen. Am Ende war das Buch okay, konnte aber bei weitem nicht mit der öffentlichen bookstagram-Meinung mithalten. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Trotzdem gibt es auf meinem Blog natürlich wieder eine ausführliche Rezension. Schaut gern vorbei. ✌🏼

Habt ihr es gelesen? Wie fandet ihr es? Vielleicht noch spannender: versteht ihr meine Kritik, oder seht ihr es vielleicht komplett anders? Lasst mal hören. ✨

EDIT: I accidentally forgot to post the last sentence of the opinion

since kikuo started working on vocaloid songs he always used accordion in a lot of his songs and some of his most popular ones. This is not against accordions as i absolutely love kikuo's accordion!! He made me like the instrument and he just uses it so beautifully. Even tho it's one of the most iconic things about his music, he used it so much that it started to get kinda overused imo (especially in kikuo miku 6). In his latest works he stopped using the instrument, and i believe it was for the best and even better for him. I think it gave him more freedom to experiment with styles even more then before and it worked seeing how he constantly tries different styles lately (which some he has barely/never done before) while still keeping the good old kikuo feel and chorus even without his iconic accordion (i'll will still miss it tho)

Agree or Disagree? Write down in the comments

Admin thoughts: I mean it's always cool to see that producers experiment and switch it up

Some might tell, you are the protagonist in the story of your life. Ga salah emang. Lau memang angle atau point of view pertama atas plot idup lau, tapi namanya bukan cerita kayak di film, drama, anime, atau apapun itu kalo semua orang adalah main character-nya kan. Dalam sebuah cerita dengan skala yang lebih besar dari isi kepala lau, akui aja deh kalo lau mungkin cuma supporting role atau bahkan villain dengan segala hal yang ada dalam hidup lau selama ini. Well, yang pasti gue juga nggak bisa jadi protagonist kalo ceritanya macem Blue Lock. Mungkin aja gugur dari awal lantaran filosofi konsep It’s All About Me-nya dan calon kalah mekanik kalo-kalo gak kedapetan fitur boost tokoh utama kayak Isagi. Tapi andai juga kalo gue di posisi Isagi, kayaknya gue pun bisa relate kalo some people are predictable due to their need to be ‘the protagonist’.

Bayangin semua post-post pembenaran yang sebagian temen atau bahkan lau sendiri sering share, valid/nggak sih kalo itu diproyeksikan dari angle orang lain di luar lau? Protagonists gak selalu mesti tertindas mulu kok, meski emang cenderung ngadepin the most significant obstacles, conflicts and complications. Tapi ya paling nggak, dia endure hardships, developing progress and propelling the plot forward. Well, whatever your belief is… Play your role wisely.

It Starts With Us by Colleen Hoover 

⭐️⭐️.5

Things I liked…
• A quick, light read 
• I’m glad they introduced Josh into the storyline because it gave us a new plot to follow 

Things I wasn’t a fan of…
• I feel very underwhelmed…I really was expecting so much more from this sequel 😔 
• This could have been an epilogue or released “It Ends With Us” with another chapter similar to what they did with “Verity”
• This book fell flat (not the emotional journey I expected) but I really thought when the last chapter rolled around it would tug at your heart strings and pack a punch, but I found that it left things super incomplete

18147909403221493;"Hannah’s Review - 
The Maid - Nita Prose

Okay, I’ve got to come clean (😉) about something… I didn’t love this book. I didn’t hate it either, but it left me exactly as it found me, which is maybe just what a book about an neuroatypical hotel maid who prides herself on taking the rooms she cleans back to their perfect original state should do. 

Whilst I liked Molly as a character I didn’t necessarily connect with her, her literal way of thinking just isn’t really my bag, I’m a girl who loves layers and nuanced emotions and there was none of that here. 

Even putting my indifference towards Molly aside, this murder mystery just wasn’t mysterious enough for me. The thing which threw me the most was where us was supposed to be located. Molly and her Grandmother have very British sensibilities and the hotel could easily have been a grand London hotspot, so I was entirely thrown when we started talking about dollars and cents and visiting The Olive Garden. 

There was one twist which I didn’t guess necessarily but for the most part I had figured out who was clean and who was dirty throughout the whole novel. I did love the nostalgic feels that the various surnames gave me though, definitely made me think of the board game Cluedo. 

It’s a book I’ll keep on my shelves because it’s so gosh darned pretty but I’ll not be reading it again.

I'm embarrassed to say I was once on the wrong side of this issue. In No Sacred Cows (https://amzn.to/3EHbj8Z), I tell the full story of how I used to be neutral toward routine infant circumcision until I read more scientific studies from the international community. It's part of a section called, ""When You're Wrong, Admit It And Move On,"" and it includes several other examples of times I was wrong. The book is also available via Kindle (https://amzn.to/3hZEryA) and Audible (https://amzn.to/2XNjUq7), and it covers basically every irrational and supernatural concept you can think of!

Unfortunately, I am going to bring you some Grinch/Scrooge vibes, so be prepared. I really disliked this book. I almost stopped at 35%, but forced myself to finish because 99% of the reviews I've seen have not only loved it, but RAVED about it. It had to get amazing, right?! Not for me. I honestly thought maybe I was reading the wrong book at one point. If you plan on reading Flock, then stop now and let me know what you think after you're done with it. And you probably should read this book because I am WAY in the minority here. 

⛔ SPOILERS! ⛔

There was so much wrong, in my personal opinion. I love bad boys in romance novels and initially got some Jax Teller from Sons of Anarchy vibes, so I was hopeful. But dang... the relationships in this are so toxic. The men are controlling, play games, basically force themselves on the main character in a couple scenes, and lead her into thinking she wants things she doesn't feel comfortable doing. And this book is just plain boring in a lot of parts. 🤷🏼‍♀️ The ending made absolutely no sense. I googled what it meant because I have no plans on reading the other books. Rant over.

3 ⭐️ for How to Marry Keanu Reeves in 90 Days by KM Jackson 

goodreads blurb: Bethany Lu Carlisle is devastated when the tabloids report actor Keanu Reeves is about to tie the knot. What?! How could the world's perfect boyfriend and forever bachelor, Keanu not realize that making move like this could potentially be devastating to the equilibrium of well everything! Not to mention, he's never come face to face with the person who could potentially be his true soulmate-her. Desperate to convince Keanu to call off the wedding, Lu and her ride-or-die BFF Truman Erikson take a wild road trip to search for the elusive Keanu so that Lu can fulfill her dream of meeting her forever crush and confess her undying love. From New York to Los Angeles, Lu and True get into all sorts of sticky situations. Will Lu be  able to find Keanu and convince him she's the one for him? Or maybe she'll discover true love has been by her side all along.

Not sure if this is a true unpopular opinion or not, but this book just was missing something. I didn’t hate, but I didn’t love either. I liked the concept. It was fun one & I loved the superstar cameos in it. I just wish that more was done with Lu & True. In my opinion, this one has a ton of potential, but fell a bit flat. But don’t take my word for it, give it a try. It was a quick read.

📚Unpopular opinion incoming 🫣
I was so excited for my library hold to come in on this one! So many people seem to love this one, but I felt very “meh” about it. I didn’t love it, didn’t hate it, just felt like it was okay. Charlie (the male lead) was a boring character and I found myself not really invested in his character or story arc. I did like that the plot revolves so much around books and felt like this story was very meta!

📚Here’s a summary of the plot:👇
Nora is a cutthroat literary agent who loves her job and her life in NYC. When her younger sister proposes a sister getaway to a small town in North Carolina, she hesitantly agrees. Her sister has dreams of Nora becoming a small town girl who falls in love with a local man. But Nora continues to have run-ins with Charlie, a big city book editor. The only thing Nora and Charlie seem to have in common is their love of books, or has their story just not been written yet?

📚I did like that Nora’s character was not your typical female lead in a romance. She even says herself that in a Hallmark movie, she’s the character you’d be rooting against. I had mixed feelings about Libby. I felt like parts of Nora and Libby’s storylines dragggggged. It was also grating on my nerves that two grown women were calling each other “sissy.”🫣 I did think the backstory of their sisterhood was really beautiful though. Overall, this one was just okay to me. However I’m definitely in the minority on this one!";2022-05-31 16:59:08+00:00;2023-03-27 14:39:16.589943+00:00;6;493;en

RATING: ⭐️⭐️.5 

this one has some awesome themes - on choices, choosing love, & finding yourself. where it fell flat was around the 40% mark - i felt bored & underwhelmed as the past/present timelines began to play out.

i also don’t love when authors incorporate similar plots over & over again (SLIGHT SPOILER: santopolo seems to frequently use infidelity)

i love Santpolo’s “The Light We Lost” so much that i think i’ve come in to this one with too high of expectations. i also went in hearing this book has “daisy jones & the six” vibes - which aside from the music incorporation, i got 0 TJR vibes.

⭐️⭐️⭐️

Read this book if you like:
🎄cutesy Hallmark movies
🤍friends to lovers
🎁 holiday romance
✨a nice, light read

What I loved:
this is DEFINITELY a great read for the holidays. I really enjoyed how easy this one was to get through, and take as old as time of friends to lovers, plus a cute little Christmas tree farm is truly just the sweetest thing to read about. Luka is the definition of an amazing guy, and we need more of those around - the way he is with his mom is SO cute.. yes everything about this book is CUTE. that is all😅

What I didn’t love:
Honestly, I think this book has a bit more hype than is warranted. There is fake dating that’s the weakest storyline of fake dating I’ve ever read, but it doesn’t at all take away from the storyline. I was hoping for a little more D R A M A (cause I love that shit) but overall I was happy with the result of this book - just thought it would impress me MORE. 

Did you feel Lovelight Farms lived up to the hype?? Or no?!";2022-12-12 17:43:56+00:00;2023-03-27 14:39:18.488265+00:00;7;62;en

Beartown by Fredrik Backman

A lot of characters, a lot of heart…but this one fell flat for me. I really WANTED to like it after all the recommendations. While it recovered some in the second half, I nearly DNFed it multiple times in the first 100 pages. There was too much character prep, descriptions and backgrounds of SO MANY of the townspeople. Too many characters with too much backstory. The first 120 pages could have been 25. 
The themes tackled were also heavy….r*pe, sexuality, acceptance, loneliness, violence and mob mentality… and while it held multiple meaningful messages by the end, it wasn’t enough. 
I know it’s the unpopular opinion, but this one was not my favorite.

Aku baru mengetahui istilah ini ketika berdiskusi dengan teman-teman. Dimulai dengan ""Eh kalian tahu nggak, buku Adam Grant, menjelaskan beberapa jenis orang dalam perdebatan,"" karena menarik, maka aku memutuskan untuk membeli buku ini beberapa bulan kemudian. 

Membaca buku ini membuatku tertampar. Karena tanpa disadari aku sering merasa ilmunya sudah banyak padahal aslinya nol besar. Sehingga membuat  diriku untuk selalu mengingat kalau masih banyak orang yang lebih pintar. Meskipun terkadang masih khilaf. 

Rethinking ini tidak hanya sekedar berpikir ulang tetapi juga memperbarui apa yang kita percaya. Apakah yang kita ketahui itu sudah outdated? Atau apakah yang kita percaya itu sudah tidak berlaku di zaman sekarang? Setelah mengetahui ini secara tidak langsung kita dituntut untuk unlearn apa yang kita percaya. 

Adam Grant menjelaskannya dengan bahasa yang cukup mudah dipahami. Selain itu, beliau juga memberikan contoh dalam penerapan rethinking di beberapa perusahaan besar dan pejabat. Sehingga lebih mudah membayangkan bagaimana rethinking itu dilakukan. Secara tidak langsung, para pejabat tersebut juga memberikan beberapa trik untuk melakukan rethinking.

Salah satunya adalah Halla Tómasdóttir yang menjelaskan jika impostor syndrome membuatnya selalu untuk belajar dan berkembang. Lalu, pengetahuan itu bagus jika dapat dari ahlinya. Sedangkan kreativitas dan kebijaksanaan bisa datang dari mana saja.

Disini aku semakin sadar kalau orang yang pintar itu seperti ilmu padi, kian berisi kian merunduk. Istilah ini ada benarnya, mereka yang sebenarnya pintar dan cerdas itu justru jarang menunjukkannya. Bahkan cenderung tidak menunjukkannya — hal ini menjadi salah satu pengingat buat saya.

Membaca buku ini juga mengingatkanku tentang pengalamanku. Ketika melihat netizen twitter berdebat, aku sering melihat kalau mereka ini merasa sempurna. Bahkan pemikiran mereka cenderung mengarah ke preacher. Merasa paling sempurna. Kedua, mereka selalu menyerang personal dimana menggunakan relationship conflict. Ketiga, mereka tidak mau dianggap bodoh.

⚠️MAMAS DONT NEED YOUR Unsolicited, biased advice! ⚠️
In particular, Moms that work full time and/or run their own business have unique challenges that (unless you also experience), you do not have the expertise to offer advice for. 🤱💼

Raising kids isn't what it used to be, either. 😅Many of the children incarnating now are on a different level, arriving to this fast paced, modern world. 👩‍💻📞📟📲📶🤳This world where 2 parent homes often require both parents to earn income. This new generation has really strong energy. 💥They are not pulling any punches. Have you met the kids of today? They will start searching for YouTube vids and connecting to bluetooth before the can talk...while we are still working on our connection. 🤣

Truth is, even moms with similar work or business  won't relate to all specific challenges of one another, either. 🤷‍♀️Every child is different. 👩‍👧👩‍👦🚼Every situation is different. If you'd like to help, it's best to just ask. 🙏

If you'd like to help out a mom ....
💚Ask: ""How can I help?""
💚Lend them a hand with cleaning or cooking
💚Offer to watch their little one while they use the restroom, take a nap or go shopping.
💚Spend time together to de-stress. 
💚Share empathy and your emotional support.
💚Listen, be present 

🙏
There are so many ways to help that are more meaningful and well received than unsolicited advice! Do you like soliciting at your front door? We don't either... 🙅‍♀️
💯
Advice unasked for undermines our decisions, authority, and agency to parent. 😠😡🤬 It's like an attack on our parenting adequacy. Advice is well received when asked for. 😉Trust me....moms who want it WILL ASK.🙋‍♀️
🙏💖
I share this with love and understanding that all people who share advice mean well. 💌I would simply like to offer some alternatives! 🙌

17887694675390044;"Oh, this book. Again? Must be a five star rating right, Zehen? Well, I'm extremely sorry to disappoint but this one might be a #unpopularopinion. 

I have had a rather complicated history with Colleen Hoover, she almost feels like an old friend I've constantly been at battle with! In school, I remember her books were all over. I also remember picking Ugly Love up because my bestfriend loved it but couldn't strike a chord with her writing.

Years later, I picked Verity. I thought this was the new beginning for my relationship with CoHo, I inhaled the pages & jumped into Layla a few months later, I was yet again reminded of why CoHo just wasn't for me and I left that book mid way (not something I do often, might I add)

Then came this book, It Ends With Us. I picked it up in hopes that with this, it would end my rocky equation with CoHo and finally spark the love I was so desperately looking for in her work. 

I'm devastated to report, this was not the case. Without giving too much away - It Ends With Us is a leap beyond the traditional romance genre. I must advise reading the trigger warnings before jumping into this one - Domestic abuse and gas lighting being the main ones. 

It seemed more like a saga, a long tale. A harrowing one at that. Lily Bloom meets Ryle Kincaid. Lily Bloom falls in love with Ryle Kincaid and that's just the beginning to an end. 

A story written with much passion, a social message that shakes you to your very core and a few well drafted paragraphs that might make a lasting impression in your fragile heart forever. 

My problem? It was within the few few pages that I realised that there were far too many red flags that bothered me. A few statements that were made initially by the male protagonist, disgusted me to be very frank.

⁠
ICYMI, over the last few weeks more entrepreneurs than usual have made announcements regarding leaving the space. There will always be people taking breaks for reasons that are none of our business, but recently people have been sharing the why. ⁠
⁠
And this has caused a very strange side effect: entrepreneurs (who aren't taking a break) sharing why they hate their business.⁠
⁠
Listen.⁠
⁠
I'm all for dropping the Instagram perfect facade.⁠

Start by auditing your offers. It's one small step that can open your eyes to a HUGE issue.⁠

Vamos a hablar de CARIÑO, CUÁNTO TE ODIO, una #romcom de #enemiestolovers en las oficinas de una editorial. A grandes rasgos, todo lo que gusta. ¿Y qué ha pasado? Pues ✨cositas✨

COSAS QUE YAY
Es entretenida, sobre todo en el 20% final. Además, los capítulos son cortos. 
Los personajes construyen una confianza creíble y la química entre ellos se nota.

COSAS QUE MEH
A pesar de leerse rápido se me hizo larguísimo.
La protagonista es infantil y obsesiva, y aunque el chico empieza medio bien y tiene comportamientos que suman puntos, al final los perdió todos.
El paso del enemies al lovers ocurre MUY pronto, de modo que la segunda parte de vuelve mucho más plana.
Lo peor, con diferencia, es la sexualización que hace Lucy del prota masculino. Si cambiásemos los géneros de los protagonistas nos llevaríamos las manos a la cabeza. Llega incluso a hacer comparaciones con el físico de otros personajes masculinos, llegando a ridiculizarlos. Esto es de vomitera, y si no lo tolero de voces masculinas, de voces femeninas tampoco.

EN RESUMEN
Lo imaginaba peor, pero la grata sorpresa final no compensa la serie que detalles horripilantes.

❄️What You’ll Find:
✔️Women’s Fiction
✔️Meet By Chance
✔️Stranded 
✔️Fate/Serendipity
✔️Single POV

📝Eight Perfect Hours by Lia Louis tells the story of Noelle and Sam who meet by chance while stranded on a highway during a blizzard. 8 hours later, when the road clears, they part ways and expect to never see each other again. But fate seems to change all that. 

Unpopular Opinion Alert. The blurb excited me, the premise a great one, but unfortunately this fell flat for me. There was nothing that really pulled me in to this story. The twists predictable. I didn’t like how it would jump from past to present inside the same paragraph. It all felt a little dysfunctional to me. And not as romantic as it’s stated to be. 

That said, what kept me reading was my love for Sam. All my (three) stars go to him. I was so intrigued by him and wanted more. Including his POV. I rooted for them in the end, they did have some chemistry, but I mostly just wanted them together because I felt like Ed was such a toad (iykyk). And he wasn’t the only one. 

A good read perhaps if your looking for a story about finding yourself with a small side of romance. So many have loved this one, so it could be perfect for you!

❄️Available now. Swipe above for the blurb.

17890334267506864;"To improvise while filming: to make up lines, motions and actions for the character you are playing without telling anyone else so they must work around you to make the scene more entertaining without ruining a take.

One cast member, James Spader did NOT like doing that as much as the others did. In fact, writers and directors claimed he often looked over scripts and asked to make changes BEFORE filming. While he ended up having some lines on screen that just about everyone loves, a method of actor James Spader (Robert California) is to not improvise. This also may be because his other show “the blacklist” did not have a use for improv like this show did. Did you know this?

17887273820498943;"Hairpin Bridge
Taylor Adams

*Unpopular Opinion Alert*

I was a big fan of No Exit and couldn’t wait to get my hands on Hairpin Bridge.

I hate to say it, but I’m pretty disappointed in this read overall. The premise of a loved one going after a perceived killer is fine but it didn’t make sense to me how Lena thought that Ray was the killer automatically. He’s a cop that pulled her over the day before. And that automatically makes him suspect #1? What?

And the jumping back and forth between Lena’s story and Cambry’s story and the blog was confusing. It seemed that Lena had a lot of knowledge from Cambry’s storyline that she wouldn’t logically have. Just because it unfolded on one timeline, doesn’t mean that the knowledge transfers to a future timeline. It seems that a lot of liberties were taken with this back and forth and that left a lot of holes in the story for me.

The blog sections were also unnecessary for the story. If you are going to try to plan out searching for a killer, why does that need to be in a public space?

I don’t know. Maybe it’s just me but this entire story seemed drawn out, based on loose plot lines with imaginary connections. 

The ending, which I think readers are meant to be happy about, just had me shrugging.

I know a lot of people love this one but it was a huge miss for me.

17882211848382060;"𝙒𝙝𝙮 𝙄 𝘿𝙉𝙁𝙚𝙙 “𝘼 𝙏𝙝𝙤𝙪𝙨𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙎𝙥𝙡𝙚𝙣𝙙𝙞𝙙 𝙎𝙪𝙣𝙨”?

Two-three months ago, I picked up this book & was very much curious to deep dive into it considering its hype & awesome reviews. But tbh, it really disappointed me a lot. I couldn’t read after some time as I found its writing dry & artificial.

Sometimes, what happens is that the previous book’s effect is carried forward in the current read. Before reading this, I had read “The God of small things” & I adored Roy’s writing a lot. TGOST has a tangled & twisted plot along with lyrical prose which I devoured & loved. When I started reading ATSS, Hosseini’s straight, simple, artificial & detached writing felt boring & worthless. Considering this, I might have thought to pick this book again at a different time; but there are more reasons because of which I won’t be reading it again.

I know the story is painful, horrific & worth listening; but he terribly failed in opening the internal worlds of his characters that troubled my imagination. I couldn’t explore Mariam more than just a wife or daughter. I couldn’t explore her as a human being beyond her roles in certain relationships. There wasn’t enough portrayal of descriptions & feelings that made me become less connected & empathetic towards characters as I turned pages by pages. I, also, think that events move fast without much detailed explanations, descriptions or reasons. I felt the straight writing supplemented the fast events resulting in a shallow plot.

The main aim of this novel was to show the world about issues or violence faced by Afghan women along with Afghanistan's political history through a fictional story. This definitely needs to be read & heard by the rest of the world as this is vital & against basic human rights. But in ATSS, I realized that all this is “purposely & artificially” written that naturally asks for other’s sympathy. But, in doing so, the novel significantly lacked natural beauty that shows Afghan women’s struggles, their day to day life & most importantly their bonds between themselves which must have been preserved & adored to survive through those harsh conditions.

I loved the setting of this book; Dreamland, a theme park which reminded me of Disneyland — I’m in for it!
The story started off pretty nice, it had so much potential. But the whole book was just insta lust (and something that was supposed to be love). The chemistry between Rowan and Zahra was odd — nothing special or deep, just plain. They were whiny and dramatic, and not in a good way. 

Also, the plot was boring. Literally nothing exciting or unpredictable happened?
Not my cup of tea.

You all know I love a romance, I do not hide that fact. I love falling in love with characters and their perfect relationships and just gushing about everything about love and hot fictional characters. I was VERY excited for this book. Let me tell you, I am beyond disappointed! At times it was just painful to read and boring (there’s slow burn and no burn). ⠀
⠀
In my opinion, this is not enemies to lovers! It is clear from the start that Aaron is madly in love with Lina and she just enjoys hating on him. Her character is SOOOO IMMATURE. Why was she talking to him through someone else from the very beginning?! It was weird. He was lovely and it’s essentially the ‘Lina hates Aaron and then magically falls in love with him’ trope. ⠀
⠀
As I didn’t connect with the characters at all, I then found little details so much more annoying. Why did Aaron always call her Catalina when nobody else did? Why did he always say he knows her when they didn’t talk before the deal? It was all just too unbelievable for me.⠀
⠀
There were also too many unexplained Spanish phrases/sentences which I’d have liked to know the meaning of, a faint that came out of nowhere (I thought she was sleeping) and don’t get me started on the spice! ‘Milking’ 🥛 gave me the ick and I’ll never recover from it! I felt so uncomfortable I had to take a break and come on my stories to talk to you all about it! ⠀
⠀
I will say, I’m very glad it was a buddy read with my girl myveryownbookclub because we made it hilarious and I’d have DNF’d it without her! It’s the lowest rating I’ve given and I’m sorry, but it’s 1.5⭐️ from me! ⠀
⠀
P.s if you scroll to picture 2, that is actually Spain rather than Gibraltar hehe!";2022-04-17 09:53:29+00:00;2023-03-27 14:39:20.374745+00:00;93;0;en

17991646816623063;"«Потому что я знаю, как надо, а они не поймут никогда»

В последнии дни я все чаще вспоминаю эту фразу из песни Золушки (мьюзикл Дмитрия Быкова dmi_bykov и Алексея Иващенко, который я смотрела в предверии Нового года несколько лет назад).

Думать, что кто-то умнее тебя - гораздо проще, чем становиться самым умным. Потому что последнее требует ответсвенности. Когда мы следуем чьим советам, когда не мыслим логически, а слепо надеемся, что кто-то знает лучше нас, то мы проживаем не свою жизнь, а какую-то марионеточную версию, где люди со стороны - кукловоды.

Я уже говорила, что именно в сепарации от общественного мнения, я нахожу свободу.

Однако эта свобода не дается просто так: отказавшись идти на поводу, ты еще и отказываешься от возможностей, к которым тебя подведут, туго застегнув ошейник. И для себя я уже четко решила, что никогда не позволю стянуть удавку на своей шее, потому что любые цели покоренные в петле уже не имеют никакого смысла.

Путь одиночки - дорога настоящей жизни, где человек хозяин, а не раб стереотипов, стигмы и общественного мнения.";2022-12-10 15:26:33+00:00;2023-03-27 14:39:20.374745+00:00;8;78;ru

⚠️ UNPOPULAR OPINION ALERT⚠️

I'm not really going to review this book other than to say I didn't like it and why. It's unfair to give it a low star rating as it's not a bad book, it's just not to my tastes!

I read this book as if I were the other mother and the baby taken was my child, I looked at everything that one mother lost over those years!!

I always thought I was quite an empathetic person but I couldn't empathise or forgive what one of these mothers did to the other. 
I felt this character was selfish and for that reason, I couldn't like or even feel sorry for them, despite the author being very sympathetic! There was also a Hero complex going on which annoyed me.

Have you read this book? Which mother did you sympathise with?

Another buddy read with Fiona bookish.browns.books I loved reading this with you and eventually, we had to come across a book that wasn’t for us!!!

17981755108658132;"Nota:⭐⭐

Hoy os traigo un libro con mucha fama en bookinstagram y tiktok, el cual a mí me decepcionó bastante.

La verdad es que me esperaba un libro mucho más duro(solo tiene un par de escenas fuertes para tanto aviso de material sensible) con más acción, no un libro tan plano que los acontecimientos casi nunca le ocurren directamente a nuestra protagonista solo se quedan pasándole cerca.

El libro empieza muy fuerte y se va deshinchado poco a poco, espero que los siguientes mejoren, puesto que no veo por ningún lado donde viene tanta fama.

SINOPSIS

Oro. Suelos de oro, paredes de oro, ropa de oro. En Highbell, en el castillo construido en las montañas heladas, todo está hecho de oro.

Incluso yo. El rey Midas me rescató. Me sacaron de los barrios bajos y me colocaron en un pedestal. Me llaman su favorita. Soy la mujer a la que tocó con oro para mostrarles a todos que le pertenezco. Para mostrar lo poderoso que es. Él me dio protección y yo le di mi corazón.

De repente, mi confianza se rompe. Mi amor es desafiado y me doy cuenta de que todo lo que creía saber sobre Midas podría estar equivocado.

Porque estos barrotes en los que estoy encerrada, por dorados que sean, siguen siendo solo una jaula.

Every Aesthetic Injector’s instagrams I come across seem to all have the exact same graphics. At first when not many people had them I loved them, but now it’s almost like too many people are using them & they’re all the same.

Don’t get me wrong, a feed that’s pretty is good to look at, but my point is that pages are becoming very similar & you need an actual strategy aligned with your goals (not just pretty graphics) so can can consistently attract your dream clients.

Dear GenZ Polyamorous Folks,

Please stop with the messaging that you have to be perfect to try polyamory. Some of us had a lot more compulsory monogamy to deconstruct while taking this leap. Y’all are a very woke generation, and I’m eternally grateful to the ways you’ve deconstructed gender, sexuality, relationship models, and more…but that also gives you a LOT of privilege over those of us who had absolutely zero access to the internet, content, resources, or a dope support system. Plus, some of us spent DECADES inside monogamy before even hearing there was another option. 

So, #UnpopularOpinion, some of us might have to engage in problematic practices (like one penis policies, or don’t ask don’t tell, or couple’s privileges) in order to learn how dysfunctional and toxic those things are. Some of us HAVE to make these mistakes simply because of the generation we were raised in. And yes we will have to experience the natural consequences of those things, which sometimes means people get hurt, but telling folks they’re “not ready” for polyamory because they need certain crutches is not supportive to those who came before you and experienced greater cultural miseducation. 🧡

18189605056188048;"A Year of Magical Thinking- Joan Didion 

“You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends”

This novel starts with the narrative of death, which parallels with the passing of the author’s husband and daughter, namely John and Quintana. This book is about Joan’s disclosure of loss, emotional sufferings, and fundamentally, the everlasting process of grief. Written in the year 2004 (a year after her tragic loss), Joan still could not extricate herself from the constant mourning and grieving. The novel further elucidates insinuation of John’s death, discussions of self-pity, and the contrast between her life prior to, and after the loss. 

It goes without saying that her style of writing is profound and the intricate portrayal of her loneliness resonated with me, yet my overall experience with the book was below my expectations. I found some of the passages repetitive and found it hard to engross in the story. I have no intention of disrespecting her work nor do I discourage you from reading this book, but I wanted to jump in here and share my overall experience and honest thoughts. The context of the book is embedded with an extensively dark undertone, meaning it’s not supposed to be an “enjoyable” read. On that account, I find it inappropriate to dictate whether the book was good or bad, in the sense that the story is based on the true events of Joan’s life. Although my review isn’t optimistic by any means, my thoughts on checking her other works remain steadfast as I plan on being unbiased from this book.

18175698694135190;"🎞️ Critical Review 🎞️

How many orgasms off Nora Ephron movies can be stuffed into a single book? Turns out zero, which is too bad because I figured that's where we were heading with the Non-stop Nora kink. Truthfully, I enjoyed this more than I was expecting. Also truthfully, I hated most of it.

I knew the opening chapter was just too cute for its own good. I got most of the endless movie references, which were fun until they drowned out actual growth. Annie. What a pompous jerk. Drew says one mildly rude thing to her, which then gives her license to say a bunch of rude things to him and also make things up about him that didn't actually happen so that it fits her loser-and-i'm-indignant-about-it narrative. I hear tell this is called banter. 😒

The Big Misunderstanding...who does that? Who takes a post-coital conquest photo of her sleeping partner to send to her friend? WHO. DOES. THAT. Sure, he's famous and yeah, it was an accident that the photo went to the wrong person. But you know what wasn't an accident? Taking and sending the photo in the first place, when he couldn't give consent to either of those things. What makes this extra adorable is that she did it knowing his most recent ex did the exact same thing to him. The roles really should've been reversed for maximum laughs, though. 😆😒

The icing on this collapsing cake is that Annie doesn't apologize for this; she's only sorry it went to the tabloid reporter (don't ask 🤦). However, she and her friend expect an apology from him anyway for leaving her house in a huff EXCEPT that she ghosts him when he tries to call her multiple times (presumably to apologize for the huffiness) just so that she can have her Grand Gesture Moment at the end. How sweet! Isn't she sweet?!

And I'll answer that, shall I, with one of my own oft-used Nora E. movie quotes: 

""Right, honey. *kiss kiss* Right."" —Victor Garber, Sleepless in Seattle

Come As You Are
Author: Jess K Hardy

Rating:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

What I Liked:
⛷️As someone who is not 25 anymore, it is so refreshing to read a story about a couple who is older. Not only did I relate to both of them, but all of the references scattered throughout the book were also a treasure as I discovered each one!

⛷️I really related to Ashley. She is such a strong FMC who has been through so much hardships, yet continues to fight to try to the find a way. 

⛷️Who wouldn’t want to read a book about an ex musician who sobered up and now helps others stay clean and sober by doing yoga half naked in the snow? Also….anyone know where I can sign up for said snowga classes? 🧘‍♂️ 

What I Didn’t Like:
⛷️I wish that Ashley’s ex had to struggle a bit more at the end. I don’t want to spoil anything but I don’t feel like he suffered enough especially considering what he does. 

Final Thoughts: 
⛷️ I truly cherished this story and the entire ski resort. I can’t wait to revisit Bluebird Basin again…hopefully soon!

Not all of them are messed up (ex: Tengaku E Ikou and breaking things into pieces), and the only reason why I think he’s misunderstood is because of Gomenne Gomenne.

— ⭐️⭐️⭐️ —

I’ve given this book a lot of thought and have ultimately decided I am super bummed about it.  I kept willing this book to be better but, my goodness, it felt like reading a textbook a lot of the time. I didn’t connect to any of the characters or feel like we really got to know them as well as I thought we would. And despite the length (540+ pages!) and the amount of years it spans, there were painstakingly detailed moments, then years that got rushed through in a paragraph or two. It was odd in its pacing. 

But the story itself was great at its core! I think this could have been written as a 350 page book and I would have been hooked!

🍕
🍕
Despite a ton of fabulous reviews, this book was NOT for me. I really could not get on board with the story’s premise. And I couldn’t stand the main character Katy… she annoyed the heck out of me. I really did love the scenic descriptions of beachy Italy, and would love to someday visit those beautiful locations. But at the end of the day this story was just too weird and too out there for this gal. QOTD: What’s your favorite kind of pizza? I love Old Forge style & Grandma pizza!

17996111482408489;"♡ Book Review ♡ 

Reckless Girls by Rachel Hawkins 
Rating: ♥ ♥ ♥

A 3 ♥ rating from me means I thought this book was good just not great. 

I really wanted to love this book and I DID, up until the last third of the book. 
The first 2/3 was wonderful, totally hooked me into what’s going on and I loved the before chapters that explained how each character got to where they are in the now/after. 

The writing is incredible, it grips you tight and doesn’t let you go. If I was reviewing this based on the writing alone it would be 5 ♥ easy. Unfortunately, I’ve got to include the actual story too. 😅 

The main reason it only gets 3 ♥ is because of the ending. 
There were some unrealistic moments in the earlier part of the story but they definitely could have been pulled off. However, the ending went from something that could have been interesting to something totally wild and unrealistic. One that left me thinking ‘what in the actual f*ck?! That’s how it ends?!’ For way too long. 

I loved The Wife Upstairs by this author but this one just didn’t quite get there for me. My time didn’t feel wasted though, even as a 3 ♥ book. This one is good and I think most will enjoy it! Thank you netgalley and stmartinspress for the e-arc! ♥️

Many times I meet people that feel ashamed that they don't do spells every day or week. Almost as if they are not worthy of calling themselves a witch which is so sad!

You are a witch if you identify as a witch! it doesn't matter what anyone says, you do whatever you prefer (unless it's not ethical).

Don't allow other people to dim your light or tell you what to do. Most of the times they just don't understand what witchcraft really is. Broom closeted or not, you are worth of calling yourself a witch!

Train them...not tame them.

Tame definition “reduced from a state of native wildness... domesticate...made docile and subdued, lacking spirit, zest, interest, or the capacity to excite.”

Train definition “to form by instruction, discipline, or drill, to make prepared for a test, to direct the growth of (like a plant) usually by pruning, and guiding, to aim at an object or objective”

These definition comparisons say it all! These little boys God gave you to raise are a bit WILD by design. With a little pruning (lots of prayer) and Godly discipline, these wild little boys who probably make you feel like you are going crazy or gaining gray hairs sometimes 🤪 will grow into capable hard working men after God’s heart that won’t shrink back in a world trying desperately to demasculate them. 

Let them have that sense of adventure mixed with a little bit of danger (of course within reason) because God has called them to be strong and courageous. 

Let them get in nature and get a little dirty, learning skills and problem solving. Not only will it be amazing to see that wonder in their eyes but someday when they have a family of their own they won’t be strangers to hard work and physical labor to provide. 

Let them pretend a stick is a “weapon”  to defend...that instinct isn’t to hurt but to PROTECT. Nurture that for good! 

Build them up daily with words of encouragement! “Wow you are so brave through Jesus! Look how strong God made you! You can do ALL things through Christ who gives you strength. I loved the way you provided for your brothers needs by helping him!”

Their father will lead by example and be the *main* one to direct them in the way God has called them as men...but mothers play an important role in coming along side husbands to rear boys who are tender enough to be molded and shaped by the things of God but with hearts ready for battle. 

“You, my Mother, have been the great means in God’s hand of rendering me what I hope I am… If I have any courage, if I feel prepared to follow my Saviour, not only into the water, but should he call me, even into the fire, I love you as the preacher to my heart of such courage.” -Charles Spurgeoun";2021-11-01 21:39:17+00:00;2023-03-27 14:39:24.049141+00:00;28;986;en

17928742043638803;"Reflections on Hemingway

Just finished this short story collection; I’m having…thoughts. I’ve read almost every fictional work of Hemingway and almost every time I read his work I’m frustrated. Especially as I get older. 
Hemingway is known for a direct prose style (in part due to his being a journalist) and at the same time an obsession with ~the implied~. With his work we constantly have to notice what is being said and what ISN’T being said. Most of the meat of Hemingway’s work is in between the lines. I quite honestly think it’s so overrated. 
For a man who prizes directness, bravery, and masculinity (read: toxic masculinity), his writing shows a cowardly man. A man who is unable to be direct in how he feels and instead needs to use literary tricks to talk about deep feelings but preserve the image he cherishes. I always find myself irritated when reading his work because I just want to scream “say what you mean!” the entire time. 
Yet I will keep torturing myself with him because his work is still so confessional even as he tries to hide his deeper feelings. His portrayal of women is his most obvious tell. If you’ve read any of his work you will know this. Hemingway is definitely one of those “literary giants” who I always read but never recommend. There are other men who have written so much more meaningful work that I don’t think people should waste their time on Hemingway (unless they like to punish themselves, like me). 

If you read Hemingway what’s your opinion of him?";2023-02-19 17:22:35+00:00;2023-03-27 14:39:25.682666+00:00;6;0;en

It really depends on the artist but sometimes whenever I listen to a song the drums feel so quiet and it hurts me so much because they are essentially the framework and backbone of music composition but they become so muffled and diluted in Vocaloid songs sometimes, which really bums me out because I love drums. It’s not really something you think about until you really try and focus on a song and see if the drums or more prominent in contrast to the guitar (which is heard more than the drums in most cases). Sometimes in songs you can hear drums but when a main melody or guitar is playing, they feel muffled (*MeMe). I think this mostly happens with metal/ hard rock type songs from producers who normally produce electronic/ pop songs, which is probably why Vocametal in general has a distinguishable sound from other parts of Vocaloid. Even a song like Nuigurumi Ni Naritai by Utsu P, which is a lot more cutesy Pop, has prominent drums. MARETU and Nayutalien also mix drums really well.

17963333318186140;"#unpopularopinion but this is exactly as it is. The main goal of every business, across all boards and fields is to make money. The role of your manager is to act as a point of contact between yourself and the top managers to maximize your performances in order to make money for the company. So whenever they tell you, they have your best interests in hand, they care about you and bla bla bla, they just mean ""I have to make sure your performance aligns with the goals and objectives of the company, £€¥$"". Not saying it's good or bad, it's just a fact. Ultimately everyone has to pay bills.

If you don't seek help and advice from an independent career coach or a third party, you'll never grow professionally. You'll narrow down your vision & professional growth to the specific requirements of the current job and company you work for. It's so important as an early stage professional to be able to see all of this and take your professional development seriously and in your own hands. Otherwise you remain stagnant in the same role and job for years without knowing what you're doing wrong.

17988146605721083;"The seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo- ein Buch, das seit Monaten nicht von der IG-Bildfläche wegzudenken ist. Ein Buch, bei dem sich die gesamte Bookstagram Community einig zu sein scheint: Noch nie habe ich flächendeckend so viel Positives zu einem Buch gelesen/gehört. Diese Euphorie kann ich einerseits verstehen- aber andererseits auch nicht und frage mich seit April, ob ich diese Rezension hier überhaupt schreiben soll, oder es einfach lassen soll. 

Um eines vorweg zu nehmen: diese Geschichte ist etwas Besonderes und damit stimme ich wohl allen himmelhochjauchzenden Liebeshymnen hier auf IG zu. 
Evelyn ist eine junge Frau, die ein Ziel hat: Sie will erfolgreich, berühmt und von allen begehrt sein. Sie macht sich in den 50er Jahren auf nach Hollywood, um als Schauspielerin genau das zu erreichen. Ihr unerbittlicher Ehrgeiz und ihre Bereitschaft auf ihrem Weg immer wieder Opfer zu bringen machen sie zu der Ikone, die sie schon immer sein wollte. Aber der Ruhm hat einen Preis. Als Evelyn ihrer wahren Liebe begegnet, wird sie vor eine folgenschwere Entscheidung gestellt: setzt sie ihre Karriere und ihren Ruf aufs Spiel und steht zu ihren tiefen Gefühlen, oder bringt sie für ihre Karriere das Opfer, das sie für immer zerstören wird? 

Der Plot ist einzigartig und zeichnet das Leben einer dreidimensionalen Frau, die der Leser im Laufe der Seiten verachtet, liebt, bewundert und hinterfragt. Es ist eine Achterbahn, die die Ambivalenz der menschlichen Natur widerspiegelt. Was mich aber nachhaltig an dieser Geschichte gestört hat, war die Tatsache, dass die Protagonisten durch kindischen Trotz und den Unwillen sich erwachsen auszusprechen immer wieder Konflikte erzeugten. Es tut weh zu sehen, wie viel Zeit verschwendet wird, weil die Protagonisten ihrem Stolz und ihrem Ego nachtrauern, anstatt sich dem Gegenüber zu öffnen und sich wirklich zuzuhören. 

Deshalb erhält das Buch von mir leider nur 3,5/5 Sternen.";2022-11-20 10:24:29+00:00;2023-03-27 14:39:25.682666+00:00;3;81;de
17954733794105938;"As a photographer specializing in elopements, location scouting online & in person for a variety of more private locations is a huge part of what I do. I can spend 10-20 hours, just doing the online research to start. Part of what I charge for is my time location scouting.

There are various reasons I usually don’t disclose or geotag locations. First, I’ve spent time, money, & effort finding those locations. So I’m not going to give out private, remote locations to just anyone. I will share locations if they are more public or well known. Second, I’m not just going to share any location with a random person that messages me online. How do I know they’ll respect the location if I don’t even know them or how do I know they won’t tell everyone about a location all over social media? The new social media guidance from leavenotraceorg also goes along with this.

So why shouldn’t you geotag exact locations? Many remote locations cannot handle the amount of traffic that social media can bring to a location. Geotagging & posting about exact trails, overlooks, lakes, summits, & other locations can overwhelm a place if it happens to blow up on social media. There is also liability placed upon myself in sharing these locations which can be remote, hard to access, or have other risks you may not know about if I just gave you the location. 

I share a lot for free in educating other photographers & providing free blogs & info on my site for couples. I go to many unnamed, remote places that aren’t found doing a simple online search.

Some locations deserve to be discovered by people willing to take the time to learn about the area & to just get out & explore! 🧭";2022-12-03 16:33:40+00:00;2023-03-27 14:39:25.682666+00:00;13;197;en

EDIT: op added a sentence

A person I follow posted something about this and I agree 100%, stop complaining that every event that references some culture is cultural appropriation!! I say this especially because of the last pjsekai event, but I saw this in other events like Revival my Dream, My Footprints your Destination, On This Canvas I Paint and On the Stage of Dazzling Light, since people who don't even have anything to do with that culture are being offended and I don’t understand why, because they have some stereotypes they don't disrespect the culture, they are just to make it easier to identify what is referenced, people are just getting mad about nothing and need to stop

Agree or Disagree? Write down in the comments

Admin thoughts: While I do agree that not every reference is cultural appropriation Sekai did weird stuff with the Gyaru and the Taisho (I asked a Korean online tho they said it's not that bad to them) situations. And while Asian media loves to do really weird references towards European culture I didn't found anything too bad in Sekai yet. On the other hand I could write an essay about how offensive Mondstadt is to me as a German

18116646061290789;"📚✨Book Review✨📚

Fates Promised
Author: Aimee Vance 

Rating:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Notes: This is book two in the series. The first book is Fates Illuminated. You definitely need to start with book 1 first. I received a copy of this book as an advanced reader, but all thoughts and opinions are my own. 

What I Liked:
🐉 Signe. Without spoiling anything, she is EVERYTHING in this book. Her strength, her relationship with Gunnar. All of it. I want to be her when I grow up!

🐉Charlene once again has an energy that is all her own. She has the most loving and accepting heart despite all the things that she has been through. The best role model for our Shelbie! 

🐉Shelbie and Domari my sweet babies ❤️❤️❤️ I love the “fish out of water” scenes we get in the beginning of the book. They made me smirk left and right. But then their story developed on a deeper level and honestly, it was beautiful. When she needs someone to support her, he’s there. When he needs help adjusting, she’s there. And then through it all Thor is by their side.🐾 

What I Didn’t Like:
🐉 The only question I had for Aimee when I finished was a. What happens to Charlene? and b. How many books will be in this series?  Why?? Because I need more immediately and it’s not far that I have to wait to find out what happens next! 

🐉Also thinking about WHEN in time Shelbie will end up at the conclusion of this series is going to keep me up at night. I think Aimee should have to buy me melatonin to compensate me 😴 

Final Thoughts: 
🐉 I will be counting the days until the next book in this series is released. It truly has evolved into an epic story. This story has heart, action, adventure, spice, heartbreak, and comedy, literally something for everyone!

I’m not entirely certain if this is an unpopular opinion actually because I’ve seen mixed reviews. This book was not for me tho. I just did not like it. I couldn’t get into it and frankly i was kind of bored. A huge chunk of this book takes place in a car chase. Like that limits things & it just got repetitive. Like i get it. He’s chasing her. She’s running. Move on please.

I was expecting something a bit different. More of a mystery on what happened to Cambry. You kind of know who did it. And really i expected it to be more of Lena investigating her sisters death rather than trying to get more details the whole time. Frankly i just didn’t care, i skipped to the end to find out what happened. Decent ending i suppose if the rest of the book was worth getting to the end.

I didn’t like it. That’s about all. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Does it ever happen where you can’t even force yourself to get through the book?

I hate writing bad reviews but i think all reviews are important. And just because this one didn’t work for me, doesn’t mean you won’t enjoy it.

May be I’m too old for YA ! 
May be I’m too old for full-length romance stories with absolutely zero plot ! Now for those of you who want to pounce on me saying this was character driven story well nope the character development was also bad ! There was total lack of depth to the characters and I did not see any chemistry between Henry and Alex #sorrynotsorry 

Also I was sooo annoyed with the foul language and crazy dialogues like seriously who even speaks like that to one another let alone mother and son (in this case) so yes the dialogues were downright awful !

And the politics.. Not going to lie I skimmed through most parts.. I could not care less …

It was such an anticipated read that disappointed me so much ! I really wanted to love it like so many others did but …. Not all five fingers are the same and this was definitely not my cup of tea ! 
 
I initially thought I was the only one who hated this book but I got so many DMs on my story update from people who also had similar problems with the book so I though I’d come here just to say - I would not recommend this book to anyone , ever !

The one thing I still don’t understand is well what is the hype about??

“The View Was Exhausting” - Mikaella Clements, Onjulli Datta

[swipe for synopsis]

REVIEW - I really don’t know where to start this one, all I know is that I hated it. It was a book club pick, and I always commit to me local and #5starorbye reads, so I was going to do my best to finish, but I absolutely couldn’t with this one. 

I first read 20% of this while I was in the hospital and didn’t vibe with it but thought “hey, maybe it’s because of what’s going on with me now.” So I literally restarted the entire book and got almost 50% through the second time and figured out no - I just really detest this damn thing 🤣

I did not understand the point of it all? I love Hollywood, I love a Hollywood romance, so the elements were there - it was just DREADFULLY boring. I was worried I’d have an unpopular opinion, but my book club didn’t love this either - it’s one of the lowest rated books we’ve ever had 😱

I appreciated the light it shined on how difficult it is for a female, specially a POC, in the entertainment industry, and all of the additional (quite frankly) bullshit they have to put up with. 

Other than that, reading this book was exhausting.

VERDICT: 2 STARS ⭐️⭐️

⁠
Just days after the Winter Solstice, when nights are long and days are short and cold, I don’t find it easy to rally myself for the mental and emotional feat of transforming my life at every level.⁠
⁠
I recently saw a quote that read: “Never trust how you feel about your entire life past 9pm.” 

I feel the same way about the depths of winter.⁠
⁠
The first day of January (especially if we’ve over-indulged in the days prior) is NOT the time to put our whole lives up for review.⁠
⁠
We think, “new year, new beginnings”.⁠
⁠
Try telling that to a bear.⁠
⁠
To me - and to all of nature, I might add - winter is a time for rest, reflection, and perhaps a little dreaming for the future.⁠
⁠
Bears know how to use the winter. So do squirrels, sunflowers, and a myriad of other natural beings.⁠
⁠
Winter is time for going underground and into hibernation.⁠
⁠
For retreating from the world and doing “indoor tasks” that we never want to do during summer months – like organising photo albums, or knitting woolly scarves by the fire. ⁠
⁠
It’s a time for nourishing ourselves physically (fattening ourselves against the cold with warming foods) and emotionally (listening to our bodies, treating ourselves with extra TLC, and sleeping more).⁠

Der Wilderer von Reinhard Kaiser-Mühlecker / s.fischer

Kurzbeschreibung:
Jakob führt den Hof der Eltern und kämpft gegen den Niedergang. Als die Künstlerin Katja sich als Praktikantin anbietet, scheinen sich die Dinge zum Guten zu wenden. Gemeinsam bauen sie eine biologische Tierhaltung auf, sie heiraten und bekommen einen Sohn. Doch Jakob findet keine Ruhe, sein grausamer Zorn bricht immer wieder hervor. Hat Katja ihn getäuscht, hat sie nur mal einen wie ihn haben wollen, einen Bauern?

Trotz Empfehlung meiner liebsten Lesefreundin lisiliebt und vieler anderer positiver Stimmen ist ""Der Wilderer"" bei mir komplett durchgefallen.
Durchweg unsympathische und unnahbare Protagonisten, deren Geschichte und Schicksal mich nicht packen und berühren konnte. 
Trostlos, freudlos, deprimierend.
Landleben von der schrecklichsten Seite. 
Kein Buch, mit dem ich meine knapp bemessene Freizeit (weiter) verbringen möchte.

I'm also not a fan of cheating as a storyline. I get it life is complex and things happen but homegirl knew she had feelings for another dude for YEARS.. if you're that unhappy with your marriage/life/choices divorce already before additional people get hurt🤷🏻‍♀️ 

Basically this whole family needs serious therapy and this book is well written but is a hot mess of abuse of all kinds and I can't get behind the gratuitous depictions of said abuse.

17915155058661236;"📸❤️. Let’s Talk Routine 

So, we’ve always been very routine oriented, from the very first day I’ve tried to find a routine that suits morgan well, we always follow routine as I feel it’s extremely important to us both. 

If we don’t follow our routine then Morgan can act out of character and get very overwhelmed, so to us we can’t just “go with the flow”. I also find it hard if we haven’t followed our routine, I also feel overwhelmed and emotional. 

I feel that a routine is important for me too, as then I know what times we are on in the day time, as chasing a toddler every day, I lose track of the time. 

Truth be told, I found the Christmas period very overwhelming and intense. Which made our routine harder to follow, now I’m having to “switch up”‘his routine to accommodate to Morgan better.

Do you have a routine or go with the flow?

Additional Information: flower's ""Ci flower"" vocal is regarded as a vocal that has an androgynous tone, meaning that it has a lack of feminine or masculine traits. It can therefore be used as both male and female roles in music. Her vocal is suitable for genres such as rock music and favours faster tempos over slow (Source: CeVIO Wiki)";2022-06-01 07:45:22+00:00;2023-03-27 14:39:27.731288+00:00;18;350;en

17887889519250576;"🎉Happy pub day to the long-awaited, much-celebrated Hairpin Bridge by Taylor Adams. 

[garden pairing: flowering red kangaroo’s paw plant  with blockbuster thriller]

🚨 Unpopular opinion alert! 🚨 This one has been hyped to the moon and back and I know a lot of folks are raving and giving it five stars. Not this girl, so if you’re gonna want to @ me best move on now! 😂🙈

I’ve got a thoughtful swap buddy who gets her hands on all the hyped ARCs and sends them on to me or I never would have had this one in my possession. I was late to the game with No Exit but read it in a snowstorm at Tahoe and really enjoyed the atmosphere and build up. Some of the same suspenseful elements and twists are present in Hairpin Bridge, but for me it was just an exercise in tedious frustration with no real payoff and far too many car chases and shoot outs. I love being inside characters’ heads but this was too much, especially since a good bit of it was just speculation on the part of our MC. I liked the twins element and the premise but the execution (so to speak 😂) just wasn’t there for me.

All that said, I must acknowledge I am picky with my thrillers! Everything must be airtight, no plot holes or implausible miracles, so take all this with a grain of 🧂 I was unimpressed by The Maidens, too 🙈(although the twist got me! 😲)

Tell me your thoughts if you’ve read Hairpin Bridge; go read it and then lmk your opinion if you haven’t.

 👑BOOK REVIEW👑

I want to start off by saying I don’t understand why everybody hates this book so strongly… I can guess at why, though I feel some of that could be a bit harsh.

My biggest problems with the book were related to the execution/editing style, and things from a writing aspect. I also had trouble liking a lot of the characters and not being able to relate to them. Though some of this may be related to certain traits and actions they possessed. 

The idea itself? Actually really great. It had amazing potential, and because of how much I loved The Selection series and her writing in the past, I am going to continue the series and read The Betrayed. I’m thinking and hoping it will be better, because as I said, this storyline DOES have a lot of potential to have the makings of a great book.

Things I liked and thought were done well: the cover and inside pages on the hardcover are absolutely stunning and breathtakingly beautiful. I liked the king’s character, though some of his actions were a little suspect and face palm. The idea was great, the clothing and ballroom aspects were lovely. I’d actually love to see a spin off about Valentina.

I think many were upset with the ending, and I can see why. But I think what the author did was purely for shock affect, and sort of a cliffhanger to lead you into the next book.

➡️A final note I want to add: 

Please be kind. You are entitled to your opinions, but remember that these words and the work in your hands is something written by real human beings, with feelings just like yours. Words can make a great impact, and one book isn’t the same as another. Bad ratings doesn’t mean the author is a bad writer. If you must use overly strong or hurtful word choice, consider restraining from tagging the author. This is somebody’s dreams, career, and mental health you could be damaging.

Thank you, and stay kind my friends. 💕

17966892224233790;"We all have beliefs about what marriage is and what it is not. These are some of my thoughts on what it is NOT. What are your unpopular opinions on marriage/relationships? Comment below!

Let me elaborate on each point...

(1) Your relationship status (married, dating, single) is just NOT the most interesting thing about you!! The parts of you that make you unique (yours interests, hobbies, passions, hopes, dreams, etc) do not become secondary or irrelevant once you are in a relationship. 

(2) Your spouse (or partner, boyfriend, girlfriend, etc) is an unique individual too. Their purpose in life (and in the relationship) is not exclusively to make your life easier. It is easy to get caught up in ""well if they would just do _______, then my life would be better"". Sure, a great partner will add positively to your life, but it doesn't mean they are ONLY here to make your life easier/better. 

(3) Having a relationship is not the most important thing in life. IMO, not everyone should even be in a relationship or get married! It is the common path for most people, but that doesn't mean it's THE path for all people to take.

(4) You are responsible for your happiness. A great partner can ADD to your happiness, but they cannot MAKE an unhappy person happy. Each individual is individually responsible for pursuing their dreams and actively creating the life they want. 

(5) Your partner cannot be your everything. Codependency is not romantic. And it's not sustainable. Either your partner will resent you for the responsibility for maintaining your life, OR they will forfeit their sense of self in order to preserve the relationship. Either way, codependency is not loving.

(6) We often can fall into the trap of defining ourselves by our relationship to others. Relationships were never meant to carry such a heavy burden. Your role in the relationship can be a reflection of your identity as a kind, compassionate, loving person. But it does not replace your identity. Who are you outside of the relationship?

[ ⭐️ ]

[ ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥] **if I could get passed the issues I had

🎞 Movie Adaptation in 2023 w/ Anne Hathaway (ages changed)

I have a lot of issues with this one, I’m going to dive in with my personal thoughts. A lot of things deterred me from liking this book unfortunately.

▫️For one, the ages stated. It was my first time reading older woman/younger man however I don’t think I have a problem with that (I will explore more) but the ages given in this one were so ICK to me.

— She’s 39 almost 40, he’s 20. Her daughter is 13. 7 year age gap between her kid and her love interest (not to mention her kid has a huge crush on him/the band & her kid also has a crush on an 18 year old in school)

— Initial meet she thinks “he couldn’t have been more than 19” 

— It’s frequently mentioned how when they go out for dinner he’s not of legal age to drink

— I would have no problem if her kid wasn’t close in age to him & the many mentions of him being so close to a minor/uncomfy situations. Even if she was 40 and he was at least 25+ would’ve been better with no kid or different age gaps chosen?? 

▫️The Dialogue/Descriptions

— Lots of long winded sentences I honestly started to skip paragraphs

— Mention that he slept with his band mate/best friends sister when he was 14 and she was 19 (ew)

— “Unfolding me with his mouth” 

— Calling a cuddle “like being in a womb”

— “the russet color of his nipples” makes me think of POTATOES 🥔 

— So many of Him: “Hiiiiiiii”, Her: “Hi, yourself”

— So many “Dittos” and “San Pellegrinos”

— Seeing his nice writing and immediate thought it was spanked into him at school

— “This feels a little like slavery. White slavery” 

▫️The Relationship

— Clearly he’s toxic/possessive. Ex) paying band member to take care of her kid so they can have sex etc

— She blames her husband for everything when she is actually a terrible parent & he is concerned about their daughter. She decided to shut off her phone while with her bf. She dismisses her kid calling her about her being upset about her newfound period etc.

17940189232609122;"So I was curious when I heard about Hawkers’ Street (at B4 of Ion Orchard) housing six famed hawker brands conveniently together under one roof. 👍 And it was one of those pig-out sessions again 😂 Really 吃吃吃 😅

Feast on:
🔹 Michelin-accredited 𝑨𝒏𝒏 𝑪𝒉𝒊𝒏 𝑷𝒐𝒑𝒊𝒂𝒉 ($2.50/roll)
🔸Old Airport Road Food Centre’s highly-raved 𝑵𝒂𝒎 𝑺𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑯𝒐𝒌𝒌𝒊𝒆𝒏 𝑴𝒆𝒆 ($6)
🔹The popular 𝑩𝒆𝒂𝒄𝒉 𝑹𝒐𝒂𝒅 𝑺𝒄𝒊𝒔𝒔𝒐𝒓𝒔-𝑪𝒖𝒕 𝑪𝒖𝒓𝒓𝒚 𝑹𝒊𝒄𝒆 ($7.80 for their Signature Curry Rice)
🔸Four-generation-old 𝑭𝒂𝒎𝒐𝒖𝒔 𝑬𝒖𝒏𝒐𝒔 𝑩𝒂𝒌 𝑪𝒉𝒐𝒓 𝑴𝒆𝒆 ($5 for their Dumpling BCM),

🔸 New kid 𝑲𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒐𝒇 𝑭𝒓𝒊𝒆𝒅 𝑹𝒊𝒄𝒆 ($6.90 for their Pork Cutlet Egg Fried Rice)

Swipe left for a clearer pic of the food I had. 

Most of the dishes were good & satisfying, in particular the aromatic, flavoursome, wok-hei-fied Hokkien Mee which I enjoyed a lot. ❤️👍 A close second would be the slurpsome BCM, which hit the proverbial spot ☺️ Wah — I finished the soup! 

What surprised me was King of Fried Rice which I never tried before (because… no opportunity and also I have heard of long lines and I’m lazy to queue up), but if I’m frank, I wasn’t too impressed. The rice was a tad sticky & wet, and you don’t get to taste the individual grains of rice as superior fried rice should be. In fact, it lacked the requisite wok hei (heat). The pork cutlet was sizeable & juicy enough, so I guess at $6.90, it’s a reasonably-priced , suitably-filling meal. It’s just that the fried rice itself fell short for me. #UnpopularOpinion haha (I might get bashed for writing this 😆 but I gotta be honest, right?!)

All in all, this was a fun, hearty feast filled with familiar favourites from beloved well-known hawkers. 
I believe Hawkers’ Street will give the basement food court a run for its money! ☺️👍 and deservedly so! I mean, yay for yummy Jian Bo 水粿 in Orchard Road, right?! 

I’ll be back! 💕

Agree or disagree? ✨ 

I think season 7 was great. It wasn’t the best season cause it’s hard to reach the level of the Flash s1 (and 3 for me) which is still the best. But one got to remember that the cast & crew had to write and shoot an ensemble based tv show that wasn’t safe in the midst of a stupid pandemic. And I think it affected the Flash more than the other shows cause of their big stunt team and special effects. That’s why I think they did their best and I enjoyed s7 for that. The only things that bugged me was how Iris & Joe barely interacted, Caitlin was just there and didn’t do anything and too much Kramer stuff 😂. But the pep talks and the forces and everything else didn’t bother me because action in every episode doesn’t matter to me. I loved to get to know different characters and the last few episodes were really really great and filled with badassery and action too. Plus the vow renewal as the perfect ending to this season 😍❤️";2021-08-07 05:42:32+00:00;2023-03-27 14:39:29.595936+00:00;44;313;en

QOTD: The one book/series you always recommend to people?
🔥🖤🔥🖤

Manon and the Thirteen will always be my Queens, from now until darkness claims me. To Whatever End. And this is, unfortunately the end. 

With this, I say goodbye to the world of Throne of Glass. It has been quite the journey, to say the least. This has topped the list as one of my all time favourite book series. I laughed a lot and cried even more. 

I would say that I'll do a reread once my heart heals, but I doubt very much that it will be healing anytime soon. 

I would recommend this series to just about anyone - actually, I beg you to read it. #UnpopularOpinion - it's better than ACOTAR. Don't come for me. 

Now please excuse me while I try and convince my bestie to read this so I don't have to suffer alone (if you're reading this, this is me calling you out).

I’ve had several people ask me how I stay motivated. Usually, I am on my own because I’m just used to it now and it’s like discipline at this point. 

But some days I’m not. Some days I don’t want to leave my bed and I want to eat all the things. 

Then I think about unnecessarily “hard” life was at 350. I look at pictures of me. And I get my life together!!! I never want to go back there. EVER. Honestly, I would be suicidal if I ever regained that much weight. Like just commit me because I would not be okay. 

I know for me, I’ve unconsciously self-sabotaged myself into a minor regain. Now that I’m aware of this - I refuse to let it happen again. For me, 212 felt like 350. And I ain’t trying to go back. Nope, not me.

Love and Other Words 
Author: Christina Lauren 

Rating:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

What I Liked:
💕While I’m not traditionally a friends to lovers fan, this one had my tummy all bubbly and filled with butterflies. It was so precious. I loved the glimpses of the past alternating with the present. It made me understand the entire story and had me hoping the two of them would work it out the entire time. 

💕This book was somehow nostalgic, gentle and really spicy all at the same time. I felt so connected to each and every one of the interactions between Macy and Elliot. They are now one of my favorite literary couples!

What I Didn’t Like:
💕The heartbreak (which was accidentally spoiled for me on TikTok 😭). It still hurt but almost more since I didn’t find out by reading and sadly found out before I got to that part. 

Final Thoughts: 
💕I’ve been a Christina Lauren fan for years and don’t plan on stopping anytime soon! This is definitely up there as one of my faves from them. My other favorite is The Soulmate Equation!

Pub date: July 6, 2021

I’m not sure about you, but I am sooo far behind on my reviews!  Summer hit me hard and even with my kids back in school since last week, nothing seems to be going right for me. I was in my very first car accident so learning what I needed to do was unnerving. Yesterday, Covid took the life of someone close to me. Sorry for being a downer lately. I’m positive that my life will slow down soon. 

Anyway, please tell me how you are doing? 

😬 Ok, please don’t crucify me for not giving this book 5 stars. 
I thought the plot and the storyline was from a very unique perspective. Two dads playing vigilantes for their two gay sons that was murdered, sounds just to me!

My problem was I just couldn’t connect with how it was written. The word “said” was so overused, I had to stop reading and listening many times because it was on repeat and it really did annoy me. 

I would give this book 3.5 stars, due to being wordy and repetitive. I however, still recommend you give it a try. 

Anyone else read this book and felt the same way?

Thank you flatiron_books macmillan.audio netgalley for my gifted copy!

17976167740828972;"""It's easier to be a successful entrepreneur with no kids and hit 50k months.""

I saw this statement on Instagram. 

And that's the truth.

Sorry not sorry 💁‍.

People need to stop normalizing ""Everyone has the same 24 hours a day"" BS.

No, I don't have the same 24 hours in a day as everyone else, let alone the same 24 hours as Beyoncé.

We may all be on the same time system, but our actions, wants, and needs aren't the same. 

We may all have the freedom to make choices, but let’s not pretend we all have the same choices, lifestyle, and responsibilities.

As a mom, I don't have 100% time freedom. I can't just attend any girls-day-out whenever I want to. Or go on an all-girls-trip to an island.

And as a mom to a child on the spectrum, my choices are different, my time allocation is different and my priorities are obviously different from a mother with a typical child (or children), and with a domestic helper.

Even if I wanted to ""hustle"" my way to become super successful, it's very unlikely it will happen as fast as someone with less responsibilities, less life challenges or someone that has been given the resources on a silver platter. 

Unless I choose to sacrifice my family, and drop all responsibilities just to achieve what I want.

You may have a different view on this, and this might be another #UnpopularOpinion to many.

This is not a rant. 

This is not aimed at anyone, I swear.

It's a culture I find misleading that's making the rounds on the internet.

It's the reality that some people sweep under the rug.

❤️❤️❤️ to all the moms (and dads!) that are working hard to make a difference for their family.

I see you 🔥❤️.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⠀

This novel follows the stories of Hailey and Beth as they try to navigate their grief and suffering alongside the story of a murderer who has a decades long track record of abducting and brutally murdering women along a highway. 

Hailey is orphaned and now living with her aunt and her cruel husband, Vaughn, in Cold Creek. When Hailey discovers Vaughn is not only aggressive and abusive, but also potentially a sexual predator or even the murderer, Hailey feels forced to run away. 

Shortly after Hailey disappears, Beth arrives in Cold Creek seeking answers about her sister’s murder. But with Vaughn onto her, is she putting herself in the killer’s path?

The novel is broken up into three parts - Hailey, Beth, and then a combination of the two. It took me several chapters to get into Hailey’s story but once the narrative picked up, I was hooked. I was disappointed when the story shifted gears to Beth’s narrative and honestly never got invested. I think this could have been better remedied if the stories were intertwined from the beginning rather than being so separate, or if Beth’s story had been significantly cut. 

Unfortunately this lag in the middle really impacted my opinion of the novel. By the time the story picked up again toward the end, I was just ready for the book to be done. 

I was also very disappointed in the missed opportunity to feature the indigenous population. The book is based off the Highway of Tears and the true story of women being abducted and murdered for decades along the highway. There were a few passing references to the First Nations population, but it wasn’t clear if any of the characters identified as First Nations (I don’t think they did unfortunately) and this could have been a nice and deeper layer to the story while also highlighting the very real and heightened threat against indigenous women and women of color in general. 

Overall, this book missed the mark for me. It's receiving stellar reviews and I suspect I’m in the minority, so if the premise intrigues you, I’d still suggest picking it up.";2021-09-22 12:34:43+00:00;2023-03-27 14:39:31.841214+00:00;13;730;en

Three books in a row that I didn’t enjoy 🤦🏼‍♀️

They all had unlikable characters. I try not to let that bother me while reading because there are times where an unlikeable character becomes a favorite character. What makes it hard is when I can’t connect with any characters, which was the case with these three.
