Just as an espresso con Panna harmoniously combines coffee and cream, this dining chair seamlessly blends colors and materials to create a minimal yet contemporary masterpiece. Every element of this chair has been meticulously crafted, resulting in a perfect fusion of comfort and design. 🤎 This contemporary chair exhibits a clever interplay of materials and colors, reminiscent of the delightful combination found in an espresso con Panna. The walnut arms gracefully connect to two legs, while a third leg features exquisite details of stainless steel with a dark bronze varnish. This thoughtful design element elevates the chair from a simple seating piece to a striking statement of style and sophistication. 🤍

Margot wore a custom two piece Pink look created by  paired with a pair of Pink  Open Toe Mules.

She also carried a Bottega Veneta Mini Cabat Leather Tote in the Colour shade Ribbon, priced at £4,030.

For jewellery, she rewore her  “Gypset” 1ct Heart Shape White Gold Hoop Earrings, priced at £30,000, Heart Shaped 2ct Button Back Ring (picture not exact) as well as their 3mm Yellow Gold Wire Band. As well her  anklet, however I am unsure if it is from a recent collection. I have posted a similar version above."

I was feeling peachy today do I'm wearing my vintage bhs knitted peach sweater with my vintage chanel headscarf along with some peachy rimmel blush and lips and of course SPF50+! I look and feel healthier too! 

Although I'm only having one of my chemo treatments now my appetite is much better, I'm putting on a bit of weight. The good thing I need to remember is that a lot of bowel cancer patients only have 3 months of chemo, 6 cycles.. I had 5 cycles of both chemos and my next chemo is my 8th cycle so I'm lucky they're giving 6 months of 12 cycles really, plus I had lots of emergency surgery to remove the bad stuff.  I'm proud of my scars and not scared to show them, they've healed so well!"

I’ve struggled (maybe a strong word) to find my space again. Struggling because I know I’ve always had great ideas but sometimes they are waaay out of the box ahead of their time and do I want to do this again? My husband says yes you can do it!! Lol. I feel that has come full circle. Let’s see how it goes. Alex has started working with a top ad agency for the summer and the creative juices in this family are out of this world. 2-10. More from the Karl Lagerfeld exhibit. The yo-yo cape revisited from another exhibit. The Asian dress was our favorite. Note the quilt book on top of his desk.     #

Hey boos & team Shereé supporters! I really want to thank every last one of u all for rocking with me over the course of these last 15 years . Just want to tell u all I appreciate the support. When shebysheree rolled out, u all supported and bought products no matter if it was a big or small purchase. I just want u to remember every successful CEO have taken several hits and or have had many failures, but did they give up? NO! Make sure to never give up on your dreams and always do something u are passionate about and tune out the noise. As as new business owner I have faced a lot of pit stops and hurdles some known and others that r unknown but I continue to push é because this is my love. I have learned a lot about the business as well as seeing those who are really by my side throughout these difficult moments. As you watch  tonight @ 8pm  EST; just know some people u may have thought had ur back or best interest do not when it when it’s really time to support. Don’t just support the DREAM, but also support the REALITY.

188,"Despite never having been to India, Lagerfeld’s imagination conjures a spectacle inspired by the last days of the British Raj. A cute lil toy train circles the centre carrying decanters, to me reminiscent of the lakhs fleeing their homes and country in trains. The set, adorned with tiers of fruits, sweets, and flowers, exudes oppressive excess. While it meant to be pretty; inspired by the life of princes, maharajas and British royals, it hid ugly realities. While Lagerfeld did insist he wasn’t trying to be realistic. He told WWD “It’s the Paris version of the idea of India,” Lagerfeld added. “It’s not a trip for documentation. I’m against reality. My life is already a reality show.” The Paris Idea of India….Not sure I want to decode that.

He brought the clichés to Paris. The collection pays homage to Bombay’s rich history as a European trading post aka colonialism. Coming from a person as problematic as Karl Lagerfeld, I’m anything but surprised.

Well, don’t get me wrong, The Clothes were GORGEOUS. The collection featured a lot of draped silhouettes, luxurious silk, crystal embroidery, metallic hues, sari-inspired garments and jewelled headpieces. Well, subtlety was never his style. Blending Parisian chic with Bombay’s charm, Lagerfeld showcases the craftsmanship of Chanel’s ateliers.

This collection as beautiful as it objectively is, makes me kind of mad. It is quite easy to dedicate a collection to a massive culture-rich country created merely out of stereotypes; similar to what Dior did for their Prefall 2023. That is another disappointing mess; we are not gonna get into it right now though. At least Chanel gave us prettier clothes.

So Basically – Love the Clothes, Hate the Idea

If you’re in Singapore, you’ve probably heard about . The hellish experience of selling your things on . Not going into details, but the users there who made an offer for this bag… yeah 🤬 I get that the bag’s white, an obscure colour for most, and the signs of use are more obvious, but let’s be more respectful and self-aware 🤗

Accessories took centre stage with the iconic braided leather chains formed into shopping baskets, satin slouchy bags with barcode tags attached, classic leather flap bags wrapped in cellophane to resemble packaged meat. 

Another introduction Karl brought to PFW was luxury sneakers in a variety of rainbow tweeds, shown in a low ankle style or knee high."

370,"Lip blushing tattoos enhance – not transform – the colour of your lips. Often, the goal of the procedure is to smooth and even out the pigment through the area. Lip blushing also allows you to inject a wash of colour into your lips – especially if the skin is particularly pale or dark. Even with the brighter pigment available, these shades typically look fairly subtle by the end of the lip blushing healing process.

Identifying your skin undertones (pink, yellow or neutral) helps determine if warm or cool-toned shades will be most flattering against your complexion. Check the colour of the veins on your wrists. If they appear blue, you have pink or cool skin undertones. If they appear green, you have yellow or warm skin undertones. If your veins have a bluish-green hue, you likely have a neutral skin tone.

Another way to determine your skin undertones is through the jewelry test. If you find gold jewelry to best complement your skin tone, you have a warm complexion. If you find silver jewelry to be most flattering, you have a more cool-toned complexion. If gold and silver jewelry equally suit you, you likely have a neutral skin tone."

The 'Metallic Bouclé And Chiffon Midi Dress' is presented in structured, shimmering metallic bouclé, its top is accented by diamanté on the pockets and buttons. Below a waist-cinching belt and peplum, a pleated chiffon skirt flows to a mid-calf length.
The Princess has worn similar styles by the same brand.

She teamed it with a new 'Classic Wallet on Chain' made of lambskin and silver-tone metal in black by chanelofficial.
She had on her black suede aquazzura bow tie pumps.

For jewellery, she wore her beautiful 'The Pearl and ‘Diamond’ Earrings' by heavenlylondon."

This captivating space is a true testament to the power of neutral tones and the enchantment of LED lights. Prepare to be inspired as the delicate blend of whites and browns immerses you in a sense of calm and serenity. 🤍 The neutral palette chosen for this design evokes a feeling of timelessness and elegance. Soft whites create a pristine canvas, while warm browns add a touch of earthy richness. The combination of these hues creates a harmonious balance, setting the stage for a space that exudes refinement and sophistication. 🤎

The Tweed de Chanel collection unveils five new tweed jewellery weaves adorned with icons dear to Gabrielle Chanel: the white ribbon, the pink camellia, the comet on a blue background, the yellow sun and the lion highlighted with flashes of red. Patrice Leguéreau shares, “I wanted to go further in the interpretation by creating a veritable fabric of precious stones that is light and supple”

⁣
💡Concrete! The bodice is hand-embroidered with small concrete cubes by Maison Montex, an atelier specializing in hand embroidery. The cubes took three years to develop and entailed 250 hours of hand work. In a feat of comparable technical ingenuity, the skirt is machine knit with iridescent silver sequins, borrowing the vernacular of the handmade but executing it with the precision of a machine—a marriage of the aesthetics as well as the practices of both the hand and the machine. // Dress, , (French, born Germany 1938–2019), House of  (French, founded 1910), fall/winter 2014–15 haute couture; Courtesy CHANEL. 📷 (image 1): © 2023 Arturo Holmes/Getty Images"

 Yevonde: Life and Colour exhibition. If you step into the new,  reopened National Portrait Gallery,  you can skip all the masses  in dance straight into a world where a woman's journey to freedom through photography unfolds before your eyes. 

Thinking more and more throughout history, portraits have held immense significance, serving as a window into the human experience. They have the power to transcend time, allowing us to connect with our ancestors, understand different cultures, and appreciate the diversity of the human spirit.

A portrait is more than just a representation of physical appearance; it encapsulates emotions, stories, and the essence of an individual or a community. From Renaissance masterpieces to modern-day expressions, portraits have documented triumphs and struggles, celebrated identities, and challenged societal norms.
With every captured moment, Yevonde broke boundaries and illuminated the path for future portrait photographers. Her artistic experimentation and unwavering passion transformed the very essence of the medium, leaving an indelible mark on the art world.

In Yevonde's enchanting works, Each portrait is a testament to the intimate relationship a  truthful collaboration that reveals layers of vulnerability, strength, and authenticity.

Portraits provide us with a mirror, reflecting the complexity and beauty of the human condition. They remind us of our shared humanity and the interconnectedness that transcends borders, cultures, and generations.

 I was really inspired by this so unknown artist reminds me back a bit of Erwin Blumenfeld  but here is a woman kaleidoscope .  The more we live in this instagram  timeslot the power of this museum is endlessly healing , capturing  fleeting moments, eternalize emotions, and trying to  shape our understanding of the world."

I’m never too bothered about splashing out on designer clothes, shoes, handbags (well, I might have one nice one 😉) etc… but I do rather like a bit of chanelofficial makeup 💄 ……. I honestly think that your skin needs loving just as much as anything else. 
If you haven’t tried their Les Beiges Bronzing Cream, then please don’t be tempted 🤣 ….. I’ve been waiting AGES for this to come back into stock, hence my sheer jubilation when the delivery chap knocked on the door earlier 🛍️. But seriously, it’s really lovely stuff …… gives a really natural glow, lasts for ages and ages and stays put all day. It’s not cheap, but actually, one pot will probably last a year, maybe longer, so I think with that in mind, it’s actually really good value.

648,"c h a n e l  SS 1995  On the tail end of fashions night of nights, The Met Ball ( which of course this year celebrated the great Karl ), this week I felt it fitting to share, possibly, my favourite Chanel collection of all time! The infamous “Barbie” collection for SS 1995 saw Karl channel a major T & A aesthetic, whilst, as always, paying homage to Coco. There were the colourful tweeds, intertwined with plastic ( Karl was always looking for new ways to manipulate and develop fabrics ), the classic suit reimagined with minis, slit to there, revealing bejewelled bikini bottoms, and of course the androgynous black and white ensembles inspired by a photograph of Coco sitting on the shoulders of good friend Serge Lifar ( which also inspired the shows finale ), circa late 20s, early 30s. Such a memorable collection that saw two of Karl’s muses, Helena and Claudia, score the seasons campaign. I LOVED this campaign! I remember plastering these images on my high school work books and binder. Quite risqué given I went to a catholic high school, in Outback Australia! As with all Chanel shows during the 90s, this was one of the most high octane and visually exciting of them all. And who could forget the models strutting the runway to Gillettes “Short Dick Man”?! I mean….

Of course I had to cover as much as I could of her wardrobe so please enjoy an overview of her main look and footwear (minus a few as I couldn't find them).

As stated in the video  has played a part in the movie and this particular outfit is from the Fall 2014 Collection.

Her footwear includes:

 Stessy Ombre Pumps
 Pink Quilted Leather Mules £2,365 on Vestiaire Collective
 Suede Maysale 50 Mules in Pink

662,"If you say Jennie is fine and happy... what do you say when she is with Jiyong?
U know I really sometimes Jennie slap delulu people and told the truth, told everything meanwhile she says nothing
When Jennie attended Harry Styles concert some delusional people said 'she went to there with V'. Well both of them attended concert with own friend circle and looks like both of them enjoyed the concert but... after the concert V shared stories and later he shared pictures of that night. But Jennie? Jennie was silent. Jennie shared nothing. If we look at only Jennie we don't know Jennie was at the concert even she enjoyed the concert and she looked happy with her friends.
Now Jennie attended Bruno Mars concert. Jiyong attended Bruno Mars concert (yes I know V also was there) but this Jennie told everything. I mean that Jennie at HS concert told everything but now this Jennie at BM concert told everything.
Obvious she enjoyed Bruno Mars concert, she was happy. But now she showed. She updated. She posted from concert. If Jennie attend a concert, she posting. But when she was at HS concert and stupid ppl started again that (false) rumor, she was silent. Now she attended same concert what Jiyong alse attended, and surprise people, Jennie is active and she posted from concert. Moreover ❣️ her post is same like Jiyong post. Jiyong posted a song from that concert and almost one hour later Jennie posted same song from concert with same lyrics 

Just look at ""two different Jennie"" what if ppl spreading false rumor with another man and what if she attend same concert with Jiyong. Just look at how she is changing, how her behavior changing...

666,"On S.K.I.N…

I get asked about my skin quite a bit, so I thought I’d share my routine and approach. 

For me, skincare is both internal and external but most importantly my routine is consistent. I am conscious that my skin is my largest organ so it is important that it is well looked after. 

Internal:
My mornings start with 1000mg of vitamin C. I generally use the effervescent version. Not only does it help with my immunity, it does wonders for my skin. 

Water: I am convinced this is the elixir of not just life but youth.

Believe it or not, I speak words of life  over my skin and my body as a whole and declare daily that ‘my youth is renewed like the eagle’ (Ps 103:5). Try it! It is life!

I eat A LOT of Fish: sushi, grilled fish, boiled fish… fish is great for Collagen and Vitamin E; my favorites are Salmon and Sea-bass. 

Fresh Juices: I will drink anything green, beet root, carrot and ginger juices all work perfectly for me.

External: 
I do products… and so I have shared some of my favorite ones on slide 3 

I use tea tree oil, my best one is from the . I use it on every spot, pimple, blackhead or white head. It reaches deep into the pores and eradicates spots. 

Serums: my ‘go-tos’ are No1 De  Serum de revitalisant au Camelia Rouge (Day) and Lancôme Génifique (Night). Both are incorporated in my routine, they last months. 

Cleansers and Toners: I have tried a few and my best is ôme - Lait Galatea Confort and Tonique Confort.  Check out the range, there’s one for your skin type for certain. 

Scrubs: My go-to is the Rose sugar scrub from… you guessed it… ôme. When my skin is feeling a little oily, I use the  7-day deep pore cleanse and scrub. 

Moisturizers: I always use a day cream and a night cream. The  Hydra Zen range has been my best so far.

It helps to know your skin type, find out and purchase products best suited for you. Your skin is definitely worth investing in.

Have an amazing week ahead and prioritize you!

Chanel's rightful home is with her maternal grandmother, Aana Arlene, where she can find solace, love, and support within her own family. Her foster parents are keeping Chanel separated from her grandmother and brother, depriving her of the nurturing relationships that are crucial for her emotional well-being and overall development

Chanel’s foster parents have proven themselves to be unfit to care for Chanel as a  , subjected her to derogatory terms such as ""native baby"" and ""Mowgli,"" along with comments suggesting exploitation for labor and even remunerating her in muktuk when she was only 9 months old. Such remarks perpetuate harmful stereotypes and demonstrate a profound lack of understanding and respect-attitudes that put Chanel’s entire identity as a Native child at risk of erasure. She deserves the opportunity to grow up with a strong sense of self and connection to the community

822,"Chanel et moi: A Singaporean Story, feat. Mira Sianipar 

The concept behind Chanel et moi: A Singaporean Story feat Mira Sianipar is a take of most of us Singaporean’s life stages. 

Stages of Life: From Cradle to Hopefully Ever After 

When we had this opportunity, we were inspired by the unfiltered lens from Chanel Métiers d’art, Dakar collection. And we wanted to tell a Singapore story that’s not usually shown in the glitzy depiction of Singapore. 

When Chanel eventually decides to do a Singapore collection, she’ll be brave enough to explore and immerse herself in the lived experiences by most of us in Singapore.

Styling & Makeup mirasianipar 

This look is another favourite of mine (yes I have a few favs from this collection 😂) The lace blouse is see-through, to make it modest, I pair with an inner top - which I do for all of my outfits. Love the button details on the sleeves as well - which most might overlook. And of course, I super duper love the tie-necklace accessory, it just elevates the whole look to edgy glam. Both from chanelofficial Métiers d’art, Dakar collection. I balance the look with a skirt - which is basically, MS classic look.
